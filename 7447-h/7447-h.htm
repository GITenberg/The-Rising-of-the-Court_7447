    <h2>
      THE RISING OF THE COURT
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh, then tell us, Sings and Judges, where our meeting is to be,
  when the laws of men are nothing, and our spirits all are free
  when the laws of men are nothing, and no wealth can hold the fort,
  There&rsquo;ll be thirst for mighty brewers at the Rising of the Court.
</pre>
    <p>
      The same dingy court room, deep and dim, like a well, with the clock high
      up on the wall, and the doors low down in it; with the bench, which, with
      some gilding, might be likened to a gingerbread imitation of a throne; the
      royal arms above it and the little witness box to one side, where so many
      honest poor people are bullied, insulted and laughed at by third-rate
      blackguardly little &ldquo;lawyers,&rdquo; and so many pitiful, pathetic and noble
      lies are told by pitiful sinners and disreputable heroes for a little
      liberty for a lost self, or for the sake of a friend&mdash;of a &ldquo;pal&rdquo; or a
      &ldquo;cobber.&rdquo; The same overworked and underpaid magistrate trying to keep his
      attention fixed on the same old miserable scene before him; as a weary,
      overworked and underpaid journalist or author strives to keep his
      attention fixed on his proofs. The same row of big, strong, healthy,
      good-natured policemen trying not to grin at times; and the police-court
      solicitors (&ldquo;the place stinks with &lsquo;em,&rdquo; a sergeant told me) wrangling
      over some miserable case for a crust, and the &ldquo;reporters,&rdquo; shabby some of
      them, eager to get a brutal joke for their papers out of the accumulated
      mass of misery before them, whether it be at the expense of the deaf,
      blind, or crippled man, or the alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      And opposite the bench, the dock, divided by a partition, with the women
      to the left and the men to the right, as it is on the stairs or the block
      in polite society. They bring children here no longer. The same shaking,
      wild-eyed, blood-shot-eyed and blear-eyed drunks and disorderlies, though
      some of the women have nerves yet; and the same decently dressed, but
      trembling and conscience-stricken little wretch up for petty larceny or
      something, whose motor car bosses of a big firm have sent a solicitor,
      &ldquo;manager,&rdquo; or some understrapper here to prosecute and give evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, over there, on a form to one side of the bench-opposite the witness
      box&mdash;and as the one bright spot in this dark, and shameful, and
      useless scene&mdash;and in a patch of sunlight from the skylight as it
      happens&mdash;sit representatives of the Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society, Prison
      Gate and Rescue Brigades, etc. (one or two of the ladies in nurses&rsquo; 
      uniforms), who are come to help us and to fight for us against the Law of
      their Land and of ours, God help us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Johnson, of Red Rock Lane, is here, and her rival in revolution,
      One-Eyed Kate, and Cock-Eyed Sal, and one or two of the other aristocrats
      of the alley. And the weeping bedraggled remains of what was once, and not
      so long ago, a pretty, slight, fair-haired and blue-eyed Australian girl.
      She is up for inciting One-Eyed Kate to resist the police. Also, Three-Pea
      Ginger, Stousher, and Wingy, for some participation in the row amongst the
      aforementioned ladies. (Wingy, by the way, is a ratty little one-armed
      man, whose case is usually described in the head-line, as &ldquo;A &lsquo;Armless
      Case,&rdquo; by one of our great dailies.) And their pals are waiting outside in
      the vestibule&mdash;Frowsy Kate (The Red Streak), Boko Bill, Pincher and
      his &ldquo;piece,&rdquo; etc., getting together the stuff for the possible fines, and
      the ten-bob fee for the lawyer, in one case, and ready to swear to
      anything, if called upon. And I myself&mdash;though I have not yet entered
      Red Rock Lane Society&mdash;on bail, on a charge of &ldquo;plain drunk.&rdquo; It was
      &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; by the way, but a kindly sergeant changed it to
      plain drunk (though I always thought my drunk was ornamental).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I am not ashamed&mdash;only comfortably dulled and a little tired&mdash;dully
      interested and observant, and hopeful for the sunlight presently. We low
      persons get too great a contempt for things to feel much ashamed at any
      time; and this very contempt keeps many of us from &ldquo;reforming.&rdquo; We hear
      too many lies sworn that we know to be lies, and see too many unjust and
      brutal things done that we know to be brutal and unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us go back a bit, and suppose we are still waiting for the
      magistrate, and think of Last Night. &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;&mdash;but from no human
      voice this time. The whispering, shuffling, and clicking of the court
      typewriter ceases, the scene darkens, and the court is blotted out as a
      scene is blotted out from the sight of a man who has thrown himself into a
      mesmeric trance. And:
    </p>
    <p>
      Drink&mdash;lurid recollection of being &ldquo;searched&rdquo;&mdash;clang of iron
      cell door, and I grope for and crawl on to the slanting plank. Period of
      oblivion&mdash;or the soul is away in some other world. Clang of cell door
      again, and soul returns in a hurry to take heed of another soul, belonging
      to a belated drunk on the plank by my side. Other soul says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gotta match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we&rsquo;re not in hell yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We fumble and light up. They leave us our pipes, tobacco and matches;
      presently, one knocks with his pipe on the iron trap of the door and asks
      for water, which is brought in a tin pint-pot. Then follow intervals of
      smoking, incoherent mutterings that pass for conversation, borrowings of
      matches, knockings with the pannikin on the cell door wicket or trap for
      more water, matches, and bail; false and fitful starts into slumber
      perhaps&mdash;or wild attempts at flight on the part of our souls into
      that other world that the sober and sane know nothing of; and, gradually,
      suddenly it seems, reason (if this world is reasonable) comes back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your trouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Bomb outrage, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But presently he is plainly uneasy (and I am getting that way, too, to
      tell the truth), and, after moving about, and walking up and down in the
      narrow space as well as we can, he &ldquo;rings up&rdquo; another policeman, who
      happens to be the fat one who is to be in charge all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I been up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killin&rsquo; a Chinaman. Go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Policeman peers in at me inquiringly, but I forbear to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blankets are thrown in by a friend of mine in the force, though we are not
      entitled to them until we are bailed or removed to the &ldquo;paddock&rdquo; (the big
      drunks&rsquo; dormitory and dining cell at the Central), and we proceed to make
      ourselves comfortable. My mate wonders whether he asked them to send to
      his wife to get bail, and hopes he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have left our wicket open, seeing, or rather hearing, that we are
      quiet. But they have seemingly left some other wickets open also, for from
      a neighbouring cell comes the voice of Mrs Johnson holding forth. The
      locomotive has apparently just been run into the cleaning sheds, and her
      fires have not had time to cool. They say that Mrs Johnson was a &ldquo;lady
      once,&rdquo; like many of her kind; that she is not a &ldquo;bad woman&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
      not a woman of loose character&mdash;but gets money sent to her from
      somewhere&mdash;from her &ldquo;family,&rdquo; or her husband, perhaps. But when she
      lets herself loose&mdash;or, rather, when the beer lets her loose&mdash;she
      is a tornado and a terror in Red Rock Lane, and it is only her fierce,
      practical kindness to her unfortunate or poverty-stricken sisters in her
      sober moments that keeps her forgiven in that classic thoroughfare. She
      can certainly speak &ldquo;like a lady&rdquo; when she likes, and like an intelligent,
      even a clever, woman&mdash;not like a &ldquo;woman of the world,&rdquo; but as a woman
      who knew and knows the world, and is in hell. But now her language is the
      language of a rough shearer in a &ldquo;rough shed&rdquo; on a blazing hot day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while my mate calls out to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake give it a rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mrs Johnson straightway opens on him and his ancestry, and his
      mental, moral, and physical condition&mdash;especially the latter. She
      accuses him of every crime known to Christian countries and some Asiatic
      and ancient ones. She wants to know how long he has been out of jail for
      kicking his wife to pieces that time when she was up as a witness against
      him, and whether he is in for the same thing again? (She has never set
      eyes on him, by the way, nor he on her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He calls back that she is not a respectable woman, and he knows all about
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she shrieks at him and bangs and kicks at her door, and demands
      his name and address. It would appear that she is a respectable woman, and
      hundreds can prove it, and she is going to make him prove it in open
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He calls back that his name is Percy Reginald Grainger, and his town
      residence is &ldquo;The Mansions,&rdquo; Macleay Street, next to Mr Isaacs, the
      magistrate, and he also gives her the address of his solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bangs and shrieks again, and states that she will get his name from
      the charge sheet in the morning and have him up for criminal libel, and
      have his cell mate up as a witness&mdash;and hers, too. But just here a
      policeman comes along and closes her wicket with a bang and cuts her off,
      so that her statements become indistinct, or come only as shrieks from a
      lost soul in an underground dungeon. He also threatens to cut us off and
      smother us if we don&rsquo;t shut up. I wonder whether they&rsquo;ve got her in the
      padded cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We settle down again, but presently my fellow captive nudges me and says:
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; From another cell comes the voice of a woman singing&mdash;the
      girl who is in for &ldquo;inciting to resist, your worship,&rdquo; in fact. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
       he says, &ldquo;that woman could sing once.&rdquo; Her voice is low and sweet and
      plaintive, as of a woman who had been a singer but had lost her voice. And
      what do you think it is?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The crowd in accents hushed reply&mdash;
  &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mrs Johnson&rsquo;s cell is suddenly silent. Then, not mimickingly, mockingly,
      or scornfully, but as if the girl is a champion of Jesus of Nazareth, and
      is hurt at the ignorance of the multitude, and pities <i>Him</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Now who is this Jesus of Nazareth, say?
</pre>
    <p>
      The policeman, coming along the passage, closes the wicket in her door,
      but softly this time, and not before we catch the plaintive words again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The crowd in accents hushed reply
  &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      My fellow felon throws the blanket off him impatiently, sits up with a
      jerk, and gropes for his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But this is red hot! Have you got another match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wonder what the Nazarene would have to say about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep for a while. I wonder whether they&rsquo;ll give us time, or we&rsquo;ll be able
      to sleep some of our sins off in the end, as we sleep our drink off here?
      Then &ldquo;The Paddock&rdquo; and day light; but there&rsquo;s little time for the Paddock
      here, for we must soon be back in court. The men borrow and lend and
      divide tobacco, lend even pipes, while some break up hard tobacco and roll
      cigarettes with bits of newspaper. If it is Sunday morning, even those who
      have no hope for bail, and have long horrible day and night before them,
      will sometimes join in a cheer as the more fortunate are bailed. But the
      others have tea and bread and butter brought to them by one of the
      Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Societies, who ask for no religion in return. They come to
      save bodies, and not to fish for souls. The men walk up and down and to
      and fro, and cross and recross incessantly, as caged men and animals
      always do&mdash;and as some uncaged men do too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any of you gentlemen want breakfast?&rdquo; Those who have money and appetites
      order; some order for the sake of the tea alone; and some &ldquo;shout&rdquo; two or
      three extra breakfasts for those who had nothing on them when they were
      run in. We low people can be very kind to each other in trouble. But now
      it&rsquo;s time to call us out by the lists, marshal us up in the passage and
      draft us into court. Ladies first. But I forgot that I am out on bail, and
      that the foregoing belongs to another occasion. Or was it only
      imagination, or hearsay? Journalists have got themselves run in before
      now, in order to see and hear and feel and smell for themselves&mdash;and
      write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! Order in the Court.&rdquo; I come like a shot out of my nightmare, or
      trance, or what you will, and we all rise as the magistrate takes his
      seat. None of us noticed him come in, but he&rsquo;s there, and I&rsquo;ve a quaint
      idea that he bowed to his audience. Kindly, humorous Mr Isaacs, whom we
      have lost, always gave me that idea. And, while he looks over his papers,
      the women seem to group themselves, unconsciously as it were, with Mrs
      Johnson as front centre, as though they depended on her in some vague way.
      She has slept it off and tidied, or been tidied, up, and is as
      clear-headed as she ever will be. Crouching directly behind her, supported
      and comforted on one side by One-Eyed Kate, and on the other by Cock-Eyed
      Sal, is the poor bedraggled little resister of the Law, sobbing
      convulsively, her breasts and thin shoulders heaving and shaking under her
      openwork blouse&mdash;the girl who seemed to pity Jesus of Nazareth last
      night in her cell. There&rsquo;s very little inciting to resist about her now.
      Most women can cry when they like, I know, and many have cried men to jail
      and the gallows; but here in this place, if a woman&rsquo;s tears can avail her
      anything, who, save perhaps a police-court solicitor and
      gentleman-by-Act-of-Parliament, would, or dare, raise a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder what the Nazarene would have to say about it if He came in to
      speak for her. But probably they&rsquo;d send Him to the receiving house as a
      person of unsound mind, or give Him worse punishment for drunkenness and
      contempt of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Worship looks up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Johnson (from the dock): &ldquo;Good morning, Mr Isaacs. How do you do?
      You&rsquo;re looking very well this morning, Mr Isaacs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Worship (from the Bench): &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs Johnson. I&rsquo;m feeling very
      well this, morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a pause, but there is no &ldquo;laughter.&rdquo; The would-be satellites don&rsquo;t
      know whom the laugh might be against. His Worship bends over the papers
      again, and I can see that he is having trouble with that quaintly humorous
      and kindly smile, or grin, of his. He has as hard a job to control his
      smile and get it off his face as some magistrates have to get a smile on
      to theirs. And there&rsquo;s a case coming by and by that he&rsquo;ll have to look a
      bit serious over. However&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Johnson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Johnson is here present, and reminds the Sergeant that she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then begins, or does begin in most courts, the same dreary old drone, like
      the giving out of a hymn, of the same dreary old charge:

    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;Are&mdash;Charged&mdash;With&mdash;Being&mdash;Drunk&mdash;And&mdash;Disorderly&mdash;In&mdash;Such&mdash;And&mdash;
      Such&mdash;A&mdash;Street&mdash;How&mdash;Do&mdash;You&mdash;Plead&mdash;Guilty&mdash;Or&mdash;Not&mdash;Guilty?&rdquo;
       But they are less orthodox here. The &ldquo;disorderly&rdquo; has dropped out of Mrs
      Johnson&rsquo;s charge somehow, on the way from the charge room. I don&rsquo;t know
      what has been going on behind the scenes, but, anyway, it is Christmas-
      time, and the Sergeant seems anxious to let Mrs Johnson off lightly. It
      means anything from twenty-four hours or five shillings to three months on
      the Island for her. The lawyers and the police&mdash;especially the
      lawyers&mdash;are secretly afraid of Mrs Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant: &ldquo;This woman has not been here for six weeks, your Worship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Johnson (who has him set and has been waiting for him for a year or
      so): &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damned lie, Mr Isaacs. I was here last Wednesday!&rdquo; Then,
      after a horrified pause in the Court: &ldquo;But I beg <i>your</i> pardon, Mr
      Isaacs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Worship&rsquo;s head goes down again. The &ldquo;laughter&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come here,
      either. There is a whispered consultation, and (it being Christmas-time)
      they compromise with Mrs Johnson for &ldquo;five shillings or the risin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
      she thanks his Worship and is escorted out, rather more hurriedly than is
      comportable with her dignity, for she remarks about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the Johnsonian sisterhood have reason to be thankful for
      the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; she has given them, for they all get off lightly, and even the
      awful resister of Law-an&rsquo;-order is forgiven. Mrs Johnson has money and is
      waiting outside to stand beers for them; she always shouts for the boys
      when she has it. And&mdash;what good does it all do?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very hard to touch the heart of a woman who is down, though they are
      intensely sympathetic amongst themselves. It is nearly as hard as it is to
      combat the pride of a hard-working woman in poverty. It was such women as
      Mrs Johnson, One-Eyed Kate, and their sisters who led Paris to Versailles;
      and a King and a Queen died for it. It is such women as Mrs Johnson and
      One-Eyed Kate and their sisters who will lead a greater Paris to a greater
      Versailles some day, and many &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; kings and queens, and their princes
      and princesses shall die for it. And that reminds me of two reports in a
      recent great daily:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Miss Angelina De Tapps, the youngest daughter of the well-known
  great family of brewers, was united in the holy bonds of matrimony
  to Mr Reginald Wells&mdash;(here follows a long account of the smart
  society wedding).  The happy pair leave en route for Europe per the
  &mdash;next Friday.

  Jane Johnson, an old offender, again faced the music before Mr
  Isaacs, S.M., at the Central yesterday morning&mdash;(here follows a
  &ldquo;humorous&rdquo; report of the case).
</pre>
    <p>
      Next time poor Mrs Johnson will leave <i>en route</i> for &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Island&rdquo; and
      stay there three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters join Mrs Johnson, who has some money and takes them to a
      favourite haunt and shouts for them&mdash;as she does for the boys
      sometimes. Their opinions on civilization are not to be printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ginger and Wingy get off with the option, and, though the fine is heavy,
      it is paid. They adjourn with Boko Bill, and their politics are lurid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squinny Peters (plain drunk&mdash;five bob or the risin&rsquo;), who is peculiar
      for always paying his fine, elects to take it out this time. It appears
      that the last time Squinny got five bob or the risin&rsquo; he ante&rsquo;d up the
      splosh like a man, and the court rose immediately, to Squinny&rsquo;s intense
      disgust. He isn&rsquo;t taking any chances this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild-Flowers-Charley, who recently did a fortnight, and has been out on
      bail, has had a few this morning, and, in spite of warnings from and
      promises to friends, insists on making a statement, though by simply
      pleading guilty he might get off easily. The statement lasts some ten
      minutes. Mr Isaacs listens patiently and politely and remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley saw the humour of it afterwards, he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what good does it all do?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no wish to treat drunkenness frivolously in beginning this sketch; I
      have seen women in the horrors&mdash;that ought to be enough.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;ROLL UP AT TALBRAGAR&rdquo;
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Jack Denver died at Talbragar when Christmas Eve began,
  And there was sorrow round the place, for Denver was a man;
  Jack Denver&rsquo;s wife bowed down her head&mdash;her daughter&rsquo;s grief was wild,
  And big Ben Duggan by the bed stood sobbing like a child.
  But big Ben Duggan saddled up, and galloped fast and far,
  To raise the longest funeral ever seen on Talbragar.

                                              -<i>Ben Duggan</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Both funerals belonged to Big Ben Duggan in a way, though Jack Denver was
      indirectly the cause of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Denver was reckoned the most popular man in the district (outside the
      principal township)&mdash;a white man and a straight man&mdash;a white
      boss and a straight sportsman. He was a squatter, though a small one; a
      real squatter who lived on his run and worked with his men&mdash;no dummy,
      super, manager for a bank, or swollen cockatoo about Jack Denver. He was
      on the committees at agricultural shows and sports, great at picnics and
      dances, beloved by school children at school feasts (I wonder if they call
      them feasts still), giver of extra or special prizes, mostly sovs. and
      half-sovs., for foot races, etc.; leading spirit for the scrub district in
      electioneering campaigns&mdash;they went as right as men could go in the
      politics of those days who watched and went the way Jack Denver went;
      header of subscription lists for burnt-out, flooded-out, sick, hurt, dead
      or killed or otherwise knocked-out selectors and others, or their
      families; barracker and agitator for new provisional schools, assister of
      his Reverence and little bush chapels, friend of all manner of wanderers&mdash;careless,
      good-hearted scamps in trouble, broken-hearted new chums, wrecks and
      failures and outcasts of any colour or creed, and especially of old King
      Jimmy and the swiftly vanishing remnant of his tribe. His big
      slab-and-shingle and brick-floored kitchen, with its skillions, built on
      more generous plans and specifications than even the house itself, was the
      wanderer&rsquo;s goal and home in bad weather. And&mdash;yes, owner, on a small
      scale, of racehorses, and a keen sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Denver and Big Ben Duggan were boys together on the old selections,
      and at the new provisional bark school at Pipeclay; they went into the
      Great North-West together &ldquo;where all the rovers go&rdquo;&mdash;stock-riding and
      droving and overlanding, and came back after a few years bronzed and
      seasoned and with wild yarns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack married and settled down on a small run his father had bought near
      Talbragar, and his generous family of tall, straight bush boys and tall,
      straight bush girls grew up and had their sweethearts. But, when Jack
      married, Big Ben Duggan went back again, up into Queensland and the Great
      North-West, with a makeshift mate who had also lost his mate through
      marriage. Ever and again, after one, and two, and three years&mdash;the
      periods of absence lengthening as the years went on&mdash;Big Ben Duggan
      would come back home, and stay a while (till the Great North-West began to
      call insistently) at Denver&rsquo;s, where he would be welcomed jubilantly by
      all&mdash;even the baby who had never seen him&mdash;for there was
      &ldquo;something about the man.&rdquo; And, until late on the night of his return, he
      and Jack would sit by the fire in winter, or outside on the woodheap in
      summer, and yarn long and fondly about the Wide Places, and strange things
      they knew and understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      How sudden things are! Ben was back (just in time for the holidays and the
      Mudgee races) out of the level lands, where distance dwells in her halls
      of shimmering haze, after following her for five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were riding home from the races, the women and children in carts and
      buggies, the men and boys on horseback&mdash;of course. They raced each
      other along the road, across short cuts, through scrub and timber, and
      back to the slow-coming overloaded vehicles again, some riding wildly and
      recklessly. Jack Denver was amongst them, his heart warmed with good luck
      at the races, good whisky to wet it, and the return of his old mate.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as good as the best of the young &lsquo;uns yet, Ben!&rdquo; he cried, as they
      swung through the trees. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we, you old&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then and there it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new chum suggested that Jack had more than he thought aboard and was
      thrown from his horse; but the new chum was repudiated with scorn and bad
      words and indignation by bushmen and bushwomen alike&mdash;as indeed he
      would be by any bushman who had seen a drunken rider ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learnt him to ride when he was a kiddy about so high,&rdquo; said old
      Break-the-News Fosbery, resentfully gasping and gulping, &ldquo;and Jack wasn&rsquo;t
      thrown.&rdquo; It was thought at first that his horse had shied and run him
      against a tree, or under an overhanging branch; but Ben Duggan had seen
      it, and explained the thing to the doctor with that strange calmness or
      quietness that comes to men in the midst of a life&rsquo;s grief. Jack was
      riding loosely, and swung forward just as the filly, a fresh young thing,
      threw back her head; and it struck him with sledge-hammer force, full in
      the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dead, even before they got him to Anderson&rsquo;s Halfway Inn. There was
      wild racing back to town for doctors, and some accidents; one horse was
      killed and another ridden to death. Others went as a forlorn hope in
      search of Doc. Wild, eccentric Yankee bush &ldquo;quack,&rdquo; who had once saved one
      of Denver&rsquo;s little girls from diphtheria; others, again, for Peter
      M&rsquo;Laughlan, bush missionary, to face the women&mdash;for they couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Ben Duggan, blubbering unashamed by the bedside, put his hand on Mrs
      Denver&rsquo;s shoulder, as she crouched there, wild-eyed, like a hunted thing.
      &ldquo;Nev&mdash;never mind, Mrs Denver!&rdquo; he blurted out, with a note as of
      indignation and defiance&mdash;just for all the world as if Jack Denver
      had done a wrong thing and the district was down on him&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have
      the longest funeral ever seen in these parts! Leave that to me.&rdquo; Then some
      of the women took her out to her daughter&rsquo;s. Big Ben Duggan gave terse
      instructions to some of the young riders about, and then, taking the best
      and freshest horse, the cross-country scrub swallowed him&mdash;west. The
      young men jumped on their horses and rode, fan-like, east.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took Jack Denver home. They always took their dead home first,
      whenever possible, and no matter the distance, before taking them to their
      last long home; and they do it yet, I suppose. They are not always so
      particular about it in cities, from what I&rsquo;ve seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was a strange funeral. They had arranged mattress and sheet in
      the bottom of a four-wheeler, and covered him with sheet, blanket, and
      quilt, though the weather was warm; and over the body, from side to side
      of the trap, they had stretched the big dark-green table-cloth from
      Anderson&rsquo;s dining-room. The long, ghostly, white, cleared government road
      between the dark walls of timber in the moonlight. The buggies and carts
      behind, and the dead-white faces and glistening or despairingly staring
      eyes of the women&mdash;wife, daughters, and nieces, and those who had
      come to help and comfort. The men&mdash;sons and brothers, and few mates
      and chums and sweethearts&mdash;riding to right and left like a bodyguard,
      to comfort and be comforted who needed comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again a brother or son&mdash;mostly a brother&mdash;riding close
      to the wheel, would suddenly throw out his arm on the mud splasher, of
      buggy or cart, and, laying his head on it, sob as he rode, careless of
      tyre and spokes, till a woman pushed him off gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of the wheel, Jim&mdash;mind the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eldest son held the most painful position, by his mother&rsquo;s side in the
      first buggy, supported by an aunt on the other side, while somebody led
      his horse. In the next buggy, between two daughters, sat a young fellow
      who was engaged to one of them&mdash;they were to be married after the
      holidays. The poor girls were white and worn out; he had an arm round
      each, and now and again they rested their heads on his shoulders. The
      younger girl would sleep by fits and starts, the sleep of exhaustion, and
      start up half laughing and happy, to be stricken wild-eyed the next moment
      by terrible reality. Some couldn&rsquo;t realize it at all&mdash;and to most of
      them all things were very dreamy, unreal and far away on that lonely,
      silent road in the moonlight&mdash;silent save for the slow, stumbling
      hoofs of tired horses, and the deliberate, half-hesitating clack-clack of
      wheel-boxes on the axles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben Duggan rode hard, as grief-stricken men ride&mdash;and walk. At Cooyal
      he woke up the solitary storekeeper and told him the news; then along that
      little-used old road for some miles both ways, and back again, rousing
      prospectors and fossickers, the butcher of the neighbourhood, clearers,
      fencers, and timber-getters, in hut and tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Duggan! Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead! Killed ridin&rsquo; home from the races!
      Funeral&rsquo;s to-morrow. Roll up at Talbragar or the nearest point you can get
      to on the government road. Tell the neighbours and folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the hoofs of Ben&rsquo;s horse would be clattering or thudding away into the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck through to Dunne&rsquo;s selection&mdash;his brother-in-law, who had
      not been to the races; then to Ross&rsquo;s farm&mdash;Old Ross was against
      racing, but struck a match at once and said something to his auld wife
      about them black trousers that belonged to the black coat and vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ben swung to the left and round behind the spurs to the school at Old
      Pipeclay, where he told the schoolmaster. Then west again to Morris&rsquo;s and
      Schneider&rsquo;s lonely farms in the deep estuary of Long Gully, and through
      the gully to the Mudgee-Gulgong road at New Pipeclay. The long, dark,
      sullenly-brooding gully through which he had gone to school in the
      glorious bush sunshine with Jack Denver, and his sweetheart&mdash;now but
      three hours his hopelessly-stricken widow; Bertha Lambert, Ben&rsquo;s
      sweetheart&mdash;married now, and newly a grandmother; Harry Dale&mdash;drowned
      in the Lachlan; Lucy Brown&mdash;Harry&rsquo;s school-day and boy-and-girl
      sweetheart&mdash;dead; and&mdash;and all the rest of them. Far away, far
      away&mdash;and near away: up in Queensland and out on the wastes of the
      Never-Never. Riding and camping, hardship and comfort, monotony and
      adventure, drought, flood, blacks, and fire; sprees and&mdash;the rest of
      it. Long dry stretches on Dead Man&rsquo;s Track. Cutting across the country in
      No Man&rsquo;s Land where there were no tracks into the Unknown. Chancing it and
      damning it. Ill luck and good luck. Laughing at it afterwards and joking
      at it always; he and Jack&mdash;always he and Jack&mdash;till Jack got
      married. The children used to say Long Gully was haunted, and always
      hurried through it after sunset. It was haunted enough now all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, raising the gap at the head of the gully, he woke suddenly and came
      back from the hazy, lazy plains; the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Level lands where Distance hides in her halls of shimmering haze,
  And where her toiling dreamers ride towards her all their days;
</pre>
    <p>
      where &ldquo;these things&rdquo; are ever far away, and Distance ever near&mdash;and
      whither he had drifted, the last hour, with Jack Denver, from the old Slab
      School.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether old Fosbery&rsquo;s got through yet?&rdquo; he muttered, with
      nervous anxiety, as he looked down on the cluster of farms and scattered
      fringe of selections in the broad moonlight. &ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s got there
      yet?&rdquo; Then, as if to reassure himself: &ldquo;He must have started an hour
      before me, and the old man can ride yet.&rdquo; He rode down towards a farm on
      Pipeclay Creek, about the centre of the cluster of farms, vineyards, and
      orchards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Fosbery&mdash;otherwise Break-the-News&mdash;was a character round
      there. If he was handy and no woman to be had, he was always sent to break
      the news to the wife of a digger or bushman who had met with an accident.
      He was old, and world-wise, and had great tact&mdash;also great experience
      in such matters. Bad news had been broken to him so many times that he had
      become hardened to it, and he had broken bad news so often that he had
      come to take a decided sort of pleasure in it&mdash;just as some bushman
      are great at funerals and will often travel miles to advise, and organize,
      and comfort, and potter round a burying and are welcomed. They had broken
      the news to old Fosbery when his boy went wrong and was &ldquo;taken&rdquo; (&ldquo;when
      they took Jim&rdquo;). They had broken the news to old Fosbery when his
      daughter, Rose, went wrong, and bolted with Flash Jack Redmond. They had
      broken the news to the old man when young Ted was thrown from his horse
      and killed. They had broken the news to the old man when the unexpected
      child of his old age and hopes was accidentally burnt to death. So the old
      man knew how it felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farm was the home of one of Jack Denver&rsquo;s married sisters, and, as
      there was no woman to go so far in the night they had sent old Fosbery to
      tell her. Folks were most uneasy and anxious, by the way, when they saw
      old Fosbery coming unexpectedly, and sometimes some of them got a bad
      start&mdash;but it helped break the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he ain&rsquo;t there, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to do it,&rdquo; thought Ben as he
      passed quietly through the upper sliprails and neared the house. &ldquo;The old
      man might have knocked up or got drunk after all. Anyway, no one might
      come in the morning till it&rsquo;s too late&mdash;it always happens that way&mdash;and&mdash;besides,
      the women&rsquo;ll want time to look up their black things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, turning the corner of the cow-yard, he gave a sigh of relief as he
      saw old Fosbery&rsquo;s horse tied up. They were up, and the big kitchen
      lighted; he caught a glimpse of a shock of white hair and bushy white
      eyebrows that could have belonged to no one except old Break-the-News.
      They were sitting at the table, the tearful wife pouring out tea, and by
      the tokens Ben knew that old Fosbery had been very successful. He rode
      quietly to the lower sliprails, let them down softly, led his horse
      carefully over them, put them up cautiously, and stood in a main road
      again. He paused to think, leaning one arm on his saddle and tickling the
      nape of his neck with his little finger; his jaw dropped, reflecting and
      grief forgotten in the business on hand, and the horse &ldquo;gave&rdquo; to him,
      thinking he was about to mount. He was tired&mdash;weary with that strange
      energetic weariness that cannot rest. It was five miles from Mudgee and
      the news was known there and must have spread a bit already; but the bulk
      of the Gulgong and Gulgong Road race-goers had passed here before the
      accident. Anyway, he thought he might as well go over and tell old
      Buckolts, of the big vineyard, across the creek, who was a great admirer
      of Jack Denver and had been drinking with him at the races that day. Old
      Buckolts was a man of weight in the district, and was always referred to
      by all from his old wife down, as &ldquo;der boss,&rdquo; and by no other term. The
      old slab farmhouse and skillions and out-houses, and the new square brick
      house built in front, were all asleep in the moonlight. The dogs woke the
      old man first (as was generally the case), as Ben opened the big white
      home gate and passed through without dismounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dat? Who voss die [there]?&rdquo; shouted the old man as the horse&rsquo;s
      hoofs crunched on the white creek-bed gravel between the two houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Duggan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot voss der matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead&mdash;killed riding home from the races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot dat you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go avay! Go home and go to sleep! You voss shoking&mdash;and trunk. Vat
      for you gum by my house mit a seely cock mit der bull shtory at dis hour
      of der night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only too true, Mr Buckolts,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;I wish to God it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got der yoomps, Pen. Go to der poomp and poomp on your head and
      den turn in someveers till ter morning. I tells von of der pot&rsquo;s to gif
      you a nip and show you a poonk. Vy! I trink mit Shack Denver not twelf
      hour ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ben persisted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drunk, Mr Buckolts, and I ain&rsquo;t got the
      horrors&mdash;I wish to God I was an&rsquo; had. Poor Jack was killed near
      Anderson&rsquo;s, riding home, about six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Ben couldn&rsquo;t see him, he could feel and hear by his tones, that old
      Buckolts sat up in bed suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mein Gott</i>! How did it happen, Pen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ven and veer voss der funeral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frett! Shonny! Villie! Sharley!&rdquo; shouted the old man at the top of his
      voice to the boys sleeping in the old house. &ldquo;Get up and pring all der
      light horses in from der patticks, and gif dem a goot feet mit plenty
      corn; and get der double-parrelled puggy ant der sinkle puggy and der
      three spring carts retty. Dere vill pe peoples vanting lifts to-morrow.
      Ant get der harnesses and sattles retty. Vake up, olt vomans!&rdquo; (Mrs
      Buckolts must have been awake by this time.) &ldquo;Call der girls ant see to
      dere plack tresses. Py Gott, ve <i>moost</i> do dis thing in style. Does
      his poor sister know over dere across the creeks, Pen? Durn out! you lazy,
      goot-for-noddings, or I will chain you up on an ants&rsquo; bed mit a rope like
      a tog; do you not hear that Shack Denver voss dett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vill sent some of der girls over dere first thing in der morning. Holt
      on, Pen, ant I vill sent you out some vine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben rode with the news to Lee&rsquo;s farm where Maurice Lee&mdash;at feud with
      Buckolts and a silent man&mdash;was, for he had known Denver all his life,
      and had gone, in his young days, on a long droving trip with him and Ben
      Duggan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Ben returned to the main road on a fresh horse. He turned
      towards Gulgong, and rode hard; past the new bark provisional school and
      along the sidings. He left the news at Con O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s lonely tin grocery
      and sly-grog shop, perched on the hillside&mdash;(&ldquo;God forgive us all!&rdquo;
       said Con O&rsquo;Donnell). He left the news at the tumble-down public-house,
      among the huts and thistles and goats that were left of the Log Paddock
      Rush. There were goats on the veranda and the place seemed dead; but there
      were startled replies and inquiries and matches struck. He left the news
      at Newton&rsquo;s selection, and Old Bones Farm, and at Foley&rsquo;s at the foot of
      Lowe&rsquo;s Peak, close under the gap between Peak and Granite Ridge. Then he
      turned west, at right angles to the main road, and took a track that was
      deserted except for one farm and on every alternate Sunday. He passed the
      lonely little slab bush &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; of the locality, that broke startlingly
      out of the scrub by the track side as he reached it; and left the news at
      Southwick&rsquo;s farm at the end of the blind track. At more than one farm he
      left the bushwoman hurriedly looking up her &ldquo;black things;&rdquo; and at more
      than one, one of the boys getting his bridle to catch his horse and ride
      elsewhere with the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben rode back, through the moonlight and the moon-shadow haunted paddocks,
      and the naked, white, ringbarked trees, along Snakes Creek, parallel with
      the main road he had recently travelled till he struck Pipeclay Creek
      again lower down. He turned down the track towards the river, and at the
      junction left word at Lowe&rsquo;s&mdash;one of the old land-grant families. The
      dogs woke an old handy man (who had been &ldquo;sent out&rdquo; in past ages for
      &ldquo;knocking a donkey off a hen-roost&ldquo;--as most of them were) and Ben told him
      to tell the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Belinfante&rsquo;s Bridge across the Cudgegong Ben struck a big camp of
      bullock-drivers, some going down with wool and some going back for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Ben,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett, from his hammock under his wagon as
      Ben was riding off&mdash;&ldquo;Hold on a minute! I want to look at yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy got his head out of his bunk very cautiously and carefully, and his
      body after it&mdash;there were nut ends of bolts, a heavy axle, and
      extremely hard projections, points, and corners within a very few short
      inches of his chaff-filled sugar-bag pillow. Slipping cannily on to his
      hands and knees, he crawled out under the tail-board, dragging his &ldquo;moles&rdquo;
       after him, and stood outside in the moonlight shaking himself into his
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was a little man who always wore a large size in moleskins&mdash;for
      some reason best known to himself&mdash;or more probably for no reason at
      all; or because of a habit he&rsquo;d got into accidentally years ago&mdash;or
      because of the motherly trousers his mother used to build for him when he
      was a boy. And he always shook himself into his pants after the manner of
      a woman shaking a pillow into a clean slip; his chin down on his chest and
      his jaw dropped, as if he&rsquo;d take himself in his teeth, after the manner of
      the woman with a pillow, were he not prevented by sound anatomical
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look reg&rsquo;lerly tuckered out, Ben,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; yer horse could do
      with a spell too. Git down, man, and have a pint er tea and a bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben got down wearily and knew at once how knocked up he was. He sat right
      down on the hard ground, embracing and drawing up his knees, and felt as
      if he&rsquo;d like never to get up again: while Jimmy shook some chaff and corn
      that he carried for his riding hack into a box for the horse, and his
      travelling mate, Billy Grimshaw, lifted his big namesake half full of cold
      tea, on to the glowing coals by the burning log&mdash;looking just like an
      orang-outang in a Crimean shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben got a fresh horse at Alfred Gentle&rsquo;s farm under the shadow of Granite
      Ridge, and then on to Canadian (th&rsquo; Canadian Lead of the roaring days),
      which had been saved from the usual fate by becoming a farming township.
      Here he roused and told the storekeeper. Then up the creek to Home Rule,
      dreariest of deserted diggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck across the ages-haunted bush, and up Chinaman&rsquo;s Creek, past &ldquo;the
      Chinamen&rsquo;s Graves,&rdquo; and through the scrub and over the ridges for the
      Talbragar Road. For he had to see Jack Denver home from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glaring, hot and dusty, lay the long, white road; coated with dust that
      felt greasy to the touch and taste. The coffin was in a four-wheeled trap,
      for the solitary hearse that Mudgee boasted then was to meet them some
      three miles out of town&mdash;at the racecourse, as it happened, by one of
      those eternal ironies of fate. (Jones, the undertaker, had had another job
      that morning.) The long string of buggies and carts and horsemen; other
      buggies and carts and horsemen drawn respectfully back amongst the trees
      here and there along the route; male hats off and held rigidly vertical
      with right ears as the coffin passed; and drivers waiting for a chance to
      draw into the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it; up early on the first morning, a long day at the races, a
      long journey home, awake and up all night with grief and sympathy. Some of
      the men had ridden till daylight; the women, worn out and exhausted, had
      perhaps an hour or so of sleep towards morning&mdash;yet they were all
      there, except Ben Duggan, on the long, hot, dusty road back, heads
      swimming in the heat and faces and hands coated with perspiration and dust&mdash;and
      never, never once breaking out of a slow walk. It would have been the same
      had it been pouring with rain. I have seen funerals trotting fast in
      London, and they are trotting more and more in Australian cities, with
      only &ldquo;the time&rdquo; for an excuse. But in the bush I have never seen a funeral
      faster than the slowest of walks no matter who or what might wait, or what
      might happen or be lost. They stood by their dead well out there. Maybe
      some of the big, simple souls had a sort of vague idea that the departed
      would stand a better show if accompanied as far as possible by the
      greatest possible number of friends&mdash;&ldquo;barrackers,&rdquo; so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here all the shallow and involuntary sham of it, the shirking of a dull
      and irksome duty&mdash;a bore, though the route be only a mile or so. The
      satisfied undertaker, and the hard-up professional mutes and mourners in
      seedy, mouldy, greeny-black, and with boozers&rsquo; faces and noses and a
      constant craving for beer to help them bear up against their grief and
      keep their mock solemn faces. Out there you were carried to the hearse or
      trap from your home, and from the hearse or trap to your grave&mdash;and
      with infinite carefulness and gentleness&mdash;on the shoulders of men,
      and of men who had known and loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been wonder and waiting in the morning for Ben Duggan; and the
      women especially, on the way home, when free from restraint, were greatly
      indignant against him. To think that he should break out and go on the
      drunk on this day of all days, when his oldest mate and friend was being
      carried to his grave. The men, knowing how he had ridden all night, found
      great excuses; but later on some grew anxious and wondered what could have
      become of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, returning home by a short cut, passed over Dead Man&rsquo;s Gap beyond
      Lowe&rsquo;s Peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what could have become of Ben Duggan.&rdquo; mused one, as they rode
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There and then their wonders ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      A party of road-clearers had been at work along the bottom, and there was
      much smoke from the burning-off, which must have made the track dim and
      vague and uncertain at night. Just at the foot of the gap, clear of the
      rough going, a newly-fallen tree lay across the track. It was stripped&mdash;had
      been stripped late the previous afternoon, in fact; and, well, you won&rsquo;t
      know, what a log like that is when the sap is well up until you have
      stepped casually on to it to take a look round. A confident skip, with
      your boot soles well greased, on to the ice in a glaciarium for the first
      time would be nothing to it in its results, I fancy. (I remember we
      children used to scrape the sap off, and eat it with satisfaction, if not
      with relish&mdash;white box I think the trees were.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben must have broken into a canter as he reached the level, as indeed his
      horse&rsquo;s tracks showed he did, and the horse must have blundered in the
      smoke, or jumped too long or too short; anyway, his long slithering shoe
      marks were in the sap on the log, and he lay there with a broken leg and
      shoulder. He had struck it near the stump and the sharp edge of an outcrop
      of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more breakneck riding, and they got a cart and some bedding and
      carried Ben to Anderson&rsquo;s, which was handiest, if not nearest, and there
      was more wild and reckless riding for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      One got a gun, and rode back to shoot the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben&rsquo;s case was hopeless from the first. He was hurt close to that big
      heart of his, as well as having a fractured skull. He talked a lot of the
      selections and old John Tierney, of the old bark school; and the
      Never-Never country with Jack&mdash;and, later on, of the present. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      Ben sayin&rsquo; now, Jim?&rdquo; asked one young bushman as another came out of the
      room with an awestruck face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; that Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead, killed ridin&rsquo; home from the races,
      an&rsquo; that the funeral&rsquo;s to-morrow, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re to roll up at Talbragar!&rdquo;
       answered the other, with wide eyes, a blank face and in an awed voice.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; to-day&rsquo;s yisterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But towards the end, under the ministrations of the doctor, Ben became
      conscious. He rolled his head a little on the pillow after he woke, and
      then, seeming to remember all that happened up to his stunning fall, he
      asked quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a funeral did Jack have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They told him it was the biggest ever seen in the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muster bin more&rsquo;n a mile long,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watcher talkin&rsquo; about, Jim?&rdquo; put in another. &ldquo;Yer talkin&rsquo; through yer
      socks. It was more&rsquo;n a mile an&rsquo; a half, Ben, if it was er inch. Some of
      the chaps timed it an&rsquo; measured it an&rsquo; compared notes as well as they
      could. Why, the head was at the Racecourse when the tail was at Old&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben sank back satisfied and a little later took the track that Jack Denver
      had taken.

      WANTED BY THE POLICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Could it have been the Soul of Man and none higher that gave spoken and
      written word to the noblest precepts of human nature? For the deeper you
      sound it the more noble it seems, in spite of all the wrong, injustice,
      sin, sorrow, pain, religion, atheism, and cynics in the world. We make (or
      are supposed to make, or allow others to make) laws for the protection of
      society, or property, or religion, or what you will; and we pay thousands
      of men like ourselves to protect those laws and see them carried out; and
      we build and maintain expensive offices, police stations, court-houses and
      jails for the protecting and carrying out of those laws, and the punishing
      of men&mdash;like ourselves&mdash;who break them. Yet, in our heart of
      hearts we are antagonistic to most of the laws, and to the Law as a whole
      (which we regard as an ass), and to the police magistrates and the judges.
      And we hate lawyers and loathe spies, pimps, and informers of all
      descriptions and the hangman with all our soul. For the Soul of Man says:
      Thou shalt not refuse refuge to the outcast, and thou shalt not betray the
      wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And those who do it we make outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we form Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Societies, and Prisoners&rsquo; Defence Societies, and
      subscribe to them and praise them and love them and encourage them to
      protect or defend men from the very laws that we pay so dearly to
      maintain. And how many of us, in the case of a crime against property&mdash;and
      though the property be public and ours&mdash;would refuse tucker to the
      hunted man, and a night&rsquo;s shelter from the pouring rain and the scowling,
      haunting, threatening, and terrifying darkness? Or show the police in the
      morning the track the poor wretch had taken? I know I couldn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heart of Man says: Thou shalt not.
    </p>
    <p>
      At country railway stations, where the trains stop for refreshments, when
      a prisoner goes up or down in charge of a policeman, a native delicacy
      prevents the local loafers from seeming to notice him; but at the last
      moment there is always some hand to thrust in a clay pipe and cake of
      tobacco, and maybe a bag of sandwiches to the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when a prisoner escapes, in the country at least&mdash;unless he be a
      criminal maniac in for a serious offence, and therefore a real danger to
      society&mdash;we all honestly hope that they won&rsquo;t catch him, and we don&rsquo;t
      hide it. And, if put in a corner, most of us would help them not to catch
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing came down through the ages and survived through the dark Middle
      Ages, as all good things come down through the ages and survive through
      the blackest ages. The hunted man in the tree, or cave, or hole, and
      strangers creeping to him with food in the darkness, and in fear and
      trembling; though he was, as often happened, an enemy to their creed,
      country, or party. For he was outcast, and hungry, and a wanderer whom men
      sought to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were mostly poor people or peasants; but it was so with the rich and
      well-to-do in the bloody Middle Ages. The Catholic country gentleman
      helping the Protestant refugee to escape disguised as a manservant (or a
      maidservant), and the Protestant country gentleman doing likewise by a
      hunted Catholic in his turn, as the battles went. Rebel helping royalist,
      and royalist helping rebel. And always, here and there, down through those
      ages, the delicate girl standing with her back to a door and her arms
      outstretched across it, and facing, with flashing eyes, the soldiers of
      the king or of the church&mdash;or entertaining and bluffing them with
      beautiful lies&mdash;to give some poor hunted devil time to hide or
      escape, though she a daughter of royalists and the church, and he a rebel
      to his king and a traitor to his creed. For they sought to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sanctuary in those times, in the monkeries&mdash;and the
      churches, where the soldiers of the king dared not go, for fear of God.
      There has been sanctuary since, in London and other places, where His or
      Her Majesty&rsquo;s police dared not go because of the fear of man. The &ldquo;Rocks&rdquo;
       was really sanctuary, even in my time&mdash;also Woollomooloo. Now the
      only sanctuary is the jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, not so far away, my masters! Down close to us in history, and in
      Merrie England, during Judge Jeffreys&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bloody Assize,&rdquo; which followed on
      the Monmouth rebellion and formed the blackest page in English history, &ldquo;a
      worthy widow named Elizabeth Gaunt was burned alive at Tyburn, for having
      sheltered a wretch who himself gave evidence against her. She settled the
      fuel about herself with her own hands, so that the flames should reach her
      quickly; and nobly said, with her last breath, that she had obeyed the
      sacred command of God, to give refuge to the outcast and not to betray the
      wanderer.&rdquo; (Charles Dickens&rsquo;s <i>History of England.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note, I am not speaking of rebel to rebel, or loyalist to loyalist, or
      comrade to comrade, or clansman to clansman in trouble&mdash;that goes
      without saying&mdash;but of man and woman to man and woman in trouble, the
      highest form of clannishness, the clannishness that embraces the whole of
      this wicked world&mdash;the Clan of Mankind!
    </p>
    <p>
      French people often helped English prisoners of war to escape to the coast
      and across the water, and English people did likewise by the French; and
      none dared raise the cry of &ldquo;traitors.&rdquo; It was the highest form of
      patriotism on both sides. And, by the way, it was, is, and shall always be
      the women who are first to pity and help the rebel refugee or the fallen
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Succour thine enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been a lot of human kindness under the smothering,
      stifling cloud of the &ldquo;System&rdquo; and behind the iron clank and swishing
      &ldquo;cat&rdquo; strokes of brutality&mdash;a lot of soul light in the darkness of
      our dark past&mdash;a page that has long since been closed down&mdash;when
      innocent men and women were transported to shame, misery, and horror; when
      mere boys were sent out on suspicion of stealing a hare from the squire&rsquo;s
      preserves, and mere girls on suspicion of lifting a riband from the
      merchant&rsquo;s counter. But the many kindly and self-sacrificing and even
      noble things that free and honest settlers did, in those days of
      loneliness and hardship, for wretched runaway convicts and others, are
      closed down with the pages too. My old grandmother used to tell me tales,
      but&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t suppose a wanted man (or a man that wasn&rsquo;t wanted,
      for that matter) ever turned away from her huts, far back in the wild
      bush, without a quart of coffee and a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; inside his hunted carcass, or
      went short of a bit of bread and meat to see him on, and a gruff but
      friendly hint, maybe, from the old man himself. And they were a type of
      the early settlers, she an English lady and the daughter of a clergyman.
      Ah! well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you ever seem to remember things that you could not possibly remember?
      Something that happened in your mother&rsquo;s life, maybe, if you are a girl,
      or your father&rsquo;s, if you are a boy&mdash;that happened to your mother or
      father some years, perhaps, before you were born. I have many such
      haunting memories&mdash;as of having once witnessed a murder, or an
      attempt at murder, for instance, and once seeing a tree fall on a man&mdash;and
      as a child I had a memory of having been a man myself once before. But
      here is one of the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hut in a dark gully; slab and stringy-bark, two rooms and a detached
      kitchen with the boys&rsquo; room roughly partitioned off it. Big clay
      fire-place with a big log fire in it. The settler, or selector, and his
      wife; another man who might have been &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; and a younger woman who
      might have been &ldquo;aunt;&rdquo; two little boys and the baby. It was raining
      heavens hard outside, and the night was as black as pitch. The uncle was
      reading a report in a paper (that seemed to have come, somehow, a long way
      from somewhere) about two men who were wanted for sheep- and
      cattle-stealing in the district. I decidedly remember it was during the
      reign of the squatters in the nearer west. There came a great gust that
      shook the kitchen and caused the mother to take up the baby out of the
      rough gin-case cradle. The father took his pipe from his mouth and said:
      &ldquo;Ah, well! poor devils.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re not out in a night like this,
      poor fellows,&rdquo; said the mother, rocking the child in her arms. &ldquo;And I hope
      they&rsquo;ll never catch &lsquo;em,&rdquo; snapped her sister. &ldquo;The squatters has enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder where poor Jim is?&rdquo; the mother moaned, rocking the baby, and
      with two of those great, silent tears starting from her haggard eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t start about Jim again, Ellen,&rdquo; said her sister impatiently. &ldquo;He
      can take care of himself. You were always rushing off to meet trouble
      half-way&mdash;time enough when they come, God knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, Ellen,&rdquo; put in Uncle Abe, soothingly, &ldquo;he was up in
      Queensland doing well when we last heerd of him. Ain&rsquo;t yer never goin&rsquo; to
      be satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim was evidently another and a younger uncle, whose temperament from
      boyhood had given his family constant cause for anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father sat smoking, resting his elbow on his knee, bunching up his
      brush of red whiskers, and looking into the fire&mdash;and back into his
      own foreign past in his own foreign land perhaps: and, it may be, thinking
      in his own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence and smoke for a while; then the mother suddenly straightened up
      and lifted a finger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! What&rsquo;s that? I thought I heard someone outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Poley coughin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe, after they&rsquo;d listened a space. &ldquo;She
      must be pretty bad&mdash;oughter give her a hot bran mash.&rdquo; (Poley was the
      best milker.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I fancied I heard horses at the sliprails,&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Prince,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe. &ldquo;Oughter let him into the shed.V
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s someone outside.&rdquo; There <i>was</i> a
      step, as of someone retreating after peeping through a crack in the door,
      but it was not old Poley&rsquo;s step; then, from farther off, a cough that was
      like old Poley&rsquo;s cough, but had a rack in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See who it is, Peter,&rdquo; said the mother. Uncle Abe, who was dramatic and
      an ass, slipped the old double-barrelled muzzle-loader from its leathers
      on the wall and stood it in the far corner and sat down by it. The mother,
      who didn&rsquo;t seem to realize anything, frowned at him impatiently. The
      coughing fit started again. It was a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? Anyone outside there?&rdquo; said the settler in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Is the boss there? I want to speak to him,&rdquo; replied a
      voice with no cough in it. The tone was reassuring, yet rather strained,
      as if there had been an accident&mdash;or it might be a cautious policeman
      or bushranger reconnoitring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better see what he wants, Peter,&rdquo; said his sister-in-law quietly.
      &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;it may be the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter threw an empty bag over his shoulders, took the peg from the door,
      opened it and stepped out. The racking fit of coughing burst forth again,
      nearer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a church-yarder!&rdquo; commented Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settler came inside and whispered to the others, who started up,
      interested. The coughing started again outside. When the fit was over the
      mother said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute till I get the boys out of the road and then bring them
      in.&rdquo; The boys were bundled into the end room and told to go to bed at
      once. They knelt up on the rough bed of slabs and straw mattress, instead,
      and applied eyes and ears to the cracks in the partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother called to the father, who had gone outside again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them to come inside, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better bring the horses into the yard first and put them under the shed,&rdquo;
       said the father to the unknown outside in the rain and darkness. Clatter
      of sliprails let down and tired hoofs over them, and sliprails put up
      again; then they came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wringing wet and apparently knocked up, a tall man with black curly hair
      and beard, black eyes and eyebrows that made his face seem the whiter;
      dressed in tweed coat, too small for him and short at the sleeves,
      strapped riding-pants, leggings, and lace-up boots, all sodden. The other
      a mere boy, beardless or clean shaven, figure and face of a native, but
      lacking in something; dressed like his mate&mdash;like drovers or
      stockmen. Arms and legs of riders, both of them; cabbage-tree hats in left
      hands&mdash;as though the right ones had to be kept ready for something
      (and looking like it)&mdash;pistol butts probably. The young man had a
      racking cough that seemed to wrench and twist his frame as the settler
      steered him to a seat on a stool by the fire. (In the intervals of
      coughing he glared round like a watched and hunted sneak-thief&mdash;as if
      the cough was something serious against the law, and he must try to stop
      it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that wet coat off him at once, Peter,&rdquo; said the settler&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;and
      let me dry it.&rdquo; Then, on second thoughts: &ldquo;Take this candle and take him
      into the house and get some dry things on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark man, who was still standing in the doorway, swung aside to let
      them pass as the settler steered the young man into the &ldquo;house;&rdquo; then
      swung back again. He stood, drooping rather, with one hand on the
      door-post; his big, wild, dark eyes kept glancing round and round the room
      and even at the ceiling, seeming to overlook or be unconscious of the
      faces after the first keen glance, but always coming back to rest on the
      door in the partition of the boys&rsquo; room opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down by the fire and rest and dry yourself?&rdquo; asked the
      settler&rsquo;s wife, rather timidly, after watching him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the door again, abstractedly it seemed, or as if he had not
      heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Uncle Abe (who, by the way, was supposed to know more than he should
      have been supposed to know) spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down, man! Set down and dry yerself. There&rsquo;s no one there except the
      boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s the boys&rsquo; room. Would yer like to look through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man seemed to rouse himself from a reverie. He let his arm and hand
      fall from the doorpost to his side like dead things. &ldquo;Thank you, missus,&rdquo;
       he said, apparently unconscious of Uncle Abe, and went and sat down in
      front of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better take your wet coat off and let me dry it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He took off his coat, and, turning the sleeve, inside out,
      hung it from his knees with the lining to the fire then he leaned forward,
      with his hands on his knees, and stared at the burning logs and steam. He
      was unarmed, or, if not, had left his pistols in the saddle-bag outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy Page, general handy-man (who was there all the time, but has not been
      mentioned yet, because he didn&rsquo;t mention anything himself which seemed
      necessary to this dark picture), now remarked to the stranger, with a
      wooden-face expression but a soft heart, that the rain would be a good
      thing for the grass, mister, and make it grow; a safe remark to make under
      the present, or, for the matter of that, under any circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger said, &ldquo;Yes; it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make it spring up like anything,&rdquo; said Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger admitted that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe joined in, or, rather, slid in, and they talked about the
      drought and the rain and the state of the country, in monosyllables
      mostly, with &ldquo;Jesso,&rdquo; and &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; till the
      settler came back with the young man dressed in rough and patched, but
      dry, clothes. He took another stool by his mate&rsquo;s side at the fire, and
      had another fit of coughing. When it was over, Uncle Abe remarked &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a regular church-yarder yer got, young feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow, too exhausted to speak, even had he intended doing so,
      turned his head in a quick, half-terrified way and gave it two short jerky
      nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settler had brought a bottle out&mdash;it was gin they kept for
      medicine. They gave him some hot, and he took it in his sudden,
      frightened, half-animal way, like a dog that was used to ill-usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be in the hospital,&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be in bed right now at once,&rdquo; snapped the sister. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
      you stay till morning, or at least till the rain clears up?&rdquo; she said to
      the elder man. &ldquo;No one ain&rsquo;t likely to come near this place in this
      weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we did he&rsquo;d stand a good chance to get both hospital and a bed pretty
      soon, and for a long stretch, too,&rdquo; said the dark man grimly. &ldquo;No, thank
      you all the same, miss&mdash;and missus&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get him fixed up all
      right and safe before morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father came into the end room with a couple of small feed boxes and
      both boys tumbled under the blankets. The father emptied some chaff, from
      a bag in the corner, into the boxes, and then dished some corn from
      another bag into the chaff and mixed it well with his hands. Then he went
      out with the boxes under his arms, and the boys got up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother had brought two chairs from the front room (I remember the kind
      well: black painted hardwood that were always coming to pieces and with
      apples painted on the backs). She stood them with their backs to the fire
      and, taking up the young man&rsquo;s wet clothes, which the settler had brought
      out under his arm and thrown on a stool, arranged them over the backs of
      chairs and the stool to dry. He lost some of his nervousness or seared
      manner under the influence of the gin, and answered one or two questions
      with reference to his complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby was in the cradle asleep. The sister drew boiling water from the
      old-fashioned fountain over one side of the fire and made coffee. The
      mother laid the coarse brownish cloth and set out the camp-oven bread,
      salt beef, tin plates, and pintpots. This was always called &ldquo;setting the
      table&rdquo; in the bush. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have it by the fire,&rdquo; said the bush-wife
      to the dark man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, missus,&rdquo; he said, as he moved to a bench by the table, &ldquo;but
      it&rsquo;s plenty warm enough here. Come on, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack, under the influence of another tot, was in a fit state to sit down
      to a table something like a Christian, instead of coming to his food like
      a beaten dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hum of bush common-places went on. One of the boys fell across the bed
      and into deep slumber; the other watched on awhile, but must have dozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was next aware, he saw, through the cracks, the taller man putting
      on his dried coat by the fire; then he went to a rough &ldquo;sofa&rdquo; at the side
      of the kitchen, where the young man was sleeping&mdash;with his head and
      shoulders curled in to the wall and his arm over his face, like a possum
      hiding from the light&mdash;and touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Jack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack sprang to his feet with a blundering rush, grappled with his mate,
      and made a break for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Jack,&rdquo; said the other, gently yet firmly, holding and
      shaking him. &ldquo;Go in with the boss and get into your own clothes&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
      got to make a start.&rdquo; The other came to himself and went inside quietly
      with the settler. The dark man stretched himself, crossed the kitchen and
      looked down at the sleeping child; he returned to the fire without
      comment. The wildness had left his eyes. The bushwoman was busy putting
      some tucker in a sugar-bag. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s tea and sugar and salt in these
      mustard tins, and they won&rsquo;t get wet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s some butter
      too; but I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll manage about the bread&mdash;I&rsquo;ve wrapped
      it up, but you&rsquo;ll have to keep it dry as well as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, missus, but that&rsquo;ll be all right. I&rsquo;ve got a bit of
      oil-cloth,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke lamely for a while, against time; then the bushwoman touched
      the spring, and their voices became suddenly low and earnest as they drew
      together. The stranger spoke as at a funeral, but the funeral was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about myself so much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m tired of it, and&mdash;and&mdash;for
      the matter of that I&rsquo;m tired of everything; but I&rsquo;d like to see poor Jack
      right, and I&rsquo;ll try to get clear myself, for his sake. You&rsquo;ve seen him. I
      can&rsquo;t blame myself, for I took him from a life that was worse than jail.
      You know how much worse than animals some brutes treat their children in
      the bush. And he was an &lsquo;adopted.&rsquo; You know what that means. He was
      idiotic with ill-treatment when I got hold of him. He&rsquo;s sensible enough
      when away with me, and true as steel. He&rsquo;s about the only living human
      thing I&rsquo;ve got to care for, or to care for me, and I want to win out of
      this hell for his sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and they were all silent. He was measuring time, as his next
      words proved: &ldquo;Jack must be nearly ready now.&rdquo; Then he took a packet from
      some inside pocket of his blue dungaree shirt. It was wrapped in
      oil-cloth, and he opened it and laid it on the table; there was a small
      Bible and a packet of letters&mdash;and portraits, maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, missus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t think me soft, and I&rsquo;m neither a
      religious man nor a hypocrite. But that Bible was given to me by my
      mother, and her hand-writing is in it, so I couldn&rsquo;t chuck it away. Some
      of the letters are hers and some&mdash;someone else&rsquo;s. You can read them
      if you like. Now, I want you to take care of them for me and dry them if
      they are a little damp. If I get clear I&rsquo;ll send for them some day, and,
      if I don&rsquo;t&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want them to be taken with me. I don&rsquo;t want
      the police to know who I was, and what I was, and who my relatives are and
      where they are. You wouldn&rsquo;t have known, if you do know now, only your
      husband knew me on the diggings, and happened to be in the court when I
      got off on that first cattle-stealing charge, and recognized me again
      to-night. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough, but I want you to remember that I&rsquo;ll
      never forget. Even if I&rsquo;m taken and have to serve my time I&rsquo;ll never
      forget it, and I&rsquo;ll live to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want no thanks, an&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t want no proofs,&rdquo; said the
      bushwoman, her voice breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sister, her eyes suspiciously bright, took up the packet in her sharp,
      practical way, and put it in a work-box she had in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settler brought the young fellow out dressed in his own clothes. The
      elder shook hands quietly all round, or, rather, they shook hands with
      him. &ldquo;Now, Jack!&rdquo; he said. They had fastened an oilskin cape round Jack&rsquo;s
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack came forward and shook hands with a nervous grip that he seemed to
      have trouble to take off. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I can
      say&mdash;I won&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo; Then they went out with the settler. The
      rain had held up a little. Clatter of sliprails down and up, but the
      settler didn&rsquo;t come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what Peter&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Showin&rsquo; &lsquo;em down the short cut,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, presently, clatter of sliprails down again, and cattle driven over
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what he&rsquo;s doing with the cows,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited in wonder, and with growing anxiety, for some quarter of an
      hour; then Abe and Andy, going out to see, met the settler coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in thunder are you doing with the cows, Peter?&rdquo; asked Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just driving them out and along a bit over those horse tracks; we
      might get into trouble,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys woke it was morning, and the mother stood by the bed. &ldquo;You
      needn&rsquo;t get up yet, and don&rsquo;t say anyone was here last night if you&rsquo;re
      asked,&rdquo; she whispered, and went out. They were up on their knees at once
      with their eyes to the cracks, and got the scare of their young lives.
      Three mounted troopers were steaming their legs at the fire&mdash;their
      bodies had been protected by oilskin capes. The mother was busy about the
      table and the sister changing the baby. Presently the two younger
      policemen sat down to bread and bacon and coffee, but their senior (the
      sergeant) stood with his back to the fire, with a pint-pot of coffee in
      his hand, eating nothing, but frowning suspiciously round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said one of the young troopers to Aunt Annie, to break the lowering
      silence, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I do; you were at Brown&rsquo;s School at Old Pipeclay&mdash;but I was
      only there a few months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you didn&rsquo;t get much sleep,&rdquo; said the senior-sergeant,
      bluntly, to the settler&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;and your sister too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so would you,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, sharply, &ldquo;if you were up with a sick
      baby all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad affair that, about Brown the schoolmaster,&rdquo; said the younger trooper
      to Aunt Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;it was indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senior-sergeant stood glowering. Presently he said brutally&mdash;&ldquo;The
      baby don&rsquo;t seem to be very sick; what&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young troopers move uneasily, and one impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen her&rdquo; (the baby) &ldquo;about twelve o&rsquo;clock last night,&rdquo;
       said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;we never thought she would live till the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the senior-sergeant, in a half-and-half tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother took the baby and held it so that its face was hidden from the
      elder policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of Brown&rsquo;s family, miss?&rdquo; asked the young trooper. &ldquo;Do you
      remember Lucy Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Aunt Annie, &ldquo;all I know is that they went
      to Sydney. But I think I heard that Lucy was married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Uncle Abe and Andy came in to breakfast. Andy sat down in the
      corner with a wooden face, and Uncle Abe, who was a tall man, took up a
      position, with his back to the fire, by the side of the senior trooper,
      and seemed perfectly at home and at ease. He lifted up his coat behind,
      and his face was a study in bucolic unconsciousness. The settler passed
      through to the boys&rsquo; room (which was harness room, feed room, tool house,
      and several other things), and as he passed out with a shovel the sergeant
      said, &ldquo;So you haven&rsquo;t seen anyone along here for three days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the settler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Jimmy Marshfield that took over Barker&rsquo;s selection in Long Gully,&rdquo;
       put in Aunt Annie. &ldquo;He was here yesterday. Do you want him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; them three fellers on horseback as rode past the corner of the lower
      paddock the day afore yesterday,&rdquo; mumbled Uncle Abe, &ldquo;but one of &lsquo;em was
      one of the Coxes&rsquo; boys, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Uncle Abe&rsquo;s voice both women started and paled, and looked
      as if they&rsquo;d like to gag him, but he was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they like?&rdquo; asked the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women paled again, but Uncle Abe described them. He had imagination,
      and was only slow where the truth was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way were they going?&rdquo; asked the constable. &ldquo;Towards Mudgee&rdquo; (the
      police-station township), said Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable gave his arm an impatient jerk and dropped Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe looked as if he wanted badly to wink hard at someone, but there
      was no friendly eye in the line of wink that would be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;that the men we&rsquo;re after didn&rsquo;t
      look up an out-of-the-way place like this for tucker, or horse-feed, or
      news, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re neither cattle duffers nor
      sympathizers; we&rsquo;re honest, hard-working people, and God knows we&rsquo;re glad
      enough to see a strange face when it comes to this lonely hole; and if you
      only want to insult us, you&rsquo;d better stop it at once. I tell you there&rsquo;s
      nobody been here but old Jimmy Marshfield for three days, and we haven&rsquo;t
      seen a stranger for over a fortnight, and that&rsquo;s enough. My sister&rsquo;s
      delicate and worried enough without you.&rdquo; She had a masculine habit of
      putting her hand up on something when holding forth, and as it happened it
      rested on the work-box on the shelf that contained the cattle-stealer&rsquo;s
      mother&rsquo;s Bible; but if put to it, Aunt Annie would have sworn on the Bible
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, no offence, no offence,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Come on, men, if
      you&rsquo;ve finished, it&rsquo;s no use wasting time round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young troopers thanked the mother for their breakfast, and strange
      to say, the one who had spoken to her went up to Aunt Annie and shook
      hands warmly with her. Then they went out, and mounting, rode back in the
      direction of Mudgee. Uncle Abe winked long and hard and solemnly at Andy
      Page, and Andy winked back like a mechanical wooden image. The two women
      nudged and smiled and seemed quite girlish, not to say skittish, all the
      morning. Something had come to break the cruel hopeless monotony of their
      lives. And even the settler became foolishly cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years later: same hut, same yard, and a not much wider clearing in
      the gully, and a little more fencing&mdash;the women rather more haggard
      and tired looking, the settler rather more horny-handed and silent, and
      Uncle Abe rather more philosophical. The men had had to go out and work on
      the stations. With the settler and his wife it was, &ldquo;If we only had a few
      pounds to get the farm cleared and fenced, and another good plough horse,
      and a few more cows.&rdquo; That had been the burden of their song for the five
      years and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one evening, the mail boy left a parcel. It was a small parcel, in
      cloth-paper, carefully tied and sealed. What could it be? It couldn&rsquo;t be
      the Christmas number of a weekly they subscribed to, for it never came
      like that. Aunt Annie cut the discussion short by cutting the string with
      a table knife and breaking the wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behold, a clean sugar-bag tightly folded and rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And inside a strong whitey-brown envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the envelope written or rather printed the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For horse-feed, stabling, and supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And underneath, in smaller letters, &ldquo;Send Bible and portraits to&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
       (Here a name and address.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And inside the envelope a roll of notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count them,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the settler&rsquo;s horny and knotty hands trembled too much, and so did his
      wife&rsquo;s withered ones; so Aunt Annie counted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; mused the settler, scratching his head in a perplexed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; gasped his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie sharply, &ldquo;fifty pounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get it settled between yer some day!&rdquo; drawled Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, after thinking comfortably over the matter, he observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast yer coffee an&rsquo; bread an&rsquo; bacon upon the waters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe never hurried himself or anybody else.

    <h2>
      THE BATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The moral should be revived. Therefore, this is a story with a moral. The
      lower end of Bill Street&mdash;otherwise William&mdash;overlooks Blue&rsquo;s
      Point Road, with a vacant wedge-shaped allotment running down from a
      Scottish church between Bill Street the aforesaid and the road, and a
      terrace on the other side of the road. A cheap, mean-looking terrace of
      houses, flush with the pavement, each with two windows upstairs and a
      large one in the middle downstairs, with a slit on one side of it called a
      door&mdash;looking remarkably skully in ghastly dawns, afterglows, and
      rainy afternoons and evenings. The slits look as if the owners of the
      skulls got it there from an upward blow of a sharp tomahawk, from a
      shorter man&mdash;who was no friend of theirs&mdash;just about the time
      they died. The slits open occasionally, and mothers of the nation, mostly
      holding their garments together at neck or bosom, lean out&mdash;at right
      angles almost&mdash;and peer up and down the road, as if they are casually
      curious as to what is keeping the rent collector so late this morning.
      Then they shut up till late in the day, when a boy or two comes home from
      work. The terrace should be called &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s Terrace&rdquo; if the road is not
      &ldquo;James&rsquo;s&rdquo; Road, because no bills ever seem to be paid there as they are in
      our street&mdash;and for other reasons. There are four houses, but seldom
      more than two of them occupied at one time&mdash;often only one. Tenants
      never shift in, or at least are never seen to, but they get there. The
      sign is a furtive candle light behind an old table cloth, a skirt, or any
      rag of dark stuff tacked across the front bedroom window, upstairs, and a
      shadow suggestive of a woman making up a bed on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If more than two of the houses are occupied there is almost certain to be
      an old granny with ragged grey hair, who folded her arms tight under her
      ragged old breasts, and bends her tough old body, and sticks her ragged
      grey old head out of the slit called a door, and squints up and down the
      road, but not in the interests of mischief-making&mdash;they are never
      here long enough&mdash;only out of mild, ragged, grey-headed curiosity
      regarding the health or affairs of the rent collector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there are no bills to be collected in Skull Terrace because no
      credit is given. No jugs are put out, because there is no place to put
      them, except on the pavement, or on the narrow window ledges, where they
      would be in great and constant danger from the feet or elbows of
      passers-by. There are no tradesmen&rsquo;s entrances to the houses in Skull
      Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenants and sub-tenants often leave on Friday morning in the full glare of
      the day. Granny throws down garments from the top window to hurry things,
      and the wife below ties up much in an old allegedly green or red
      table-cloth, on the pavement, at the last moment. Van of the &ldquo;bottle ho&rdquo;
       variety. It is all done very quickly, and nobody takes any notice&mdash;they
      are never there long enough. Landlord, landlady, or rent collector&mdash;or
      whatever it is&mdash;calls later on; maybe, knocks in a tired, even bored,
      way; makes inquiries next door, and goes away, leaving the problem to take
      care of itself&mdash;all kind of casual. The business people of North
      Sydney, especially removers and labourers, are very casual. Down old
      Blue&rsquo;s Point Road the folk get so casual that they just exist, but don&rsquo;t
      seem to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I never could make out about Skull Terrace is that when one
      house becomes vacant from a house agent&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;there is a
      permanent atmosphere of vacancy about the whole terrace&mdash;the people
      of another move into it. And there&rsquo;s not the slightest difference between
      the houses. It is because the removal is such a small affair, I suppose,
      and the change is, the main thing. I always do better for awhile in a new
      house&mdash;but then I always did seem to get on better somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many points, or absence of points, about Skull Terrace that fit
      in with Jim&rsquo;s casualness as against Bill&rsquo;s character, therefore Blue&rsquo;s
      Point Road ought to be James&rsquo;s Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just now, in the heat of summer, the terrace happens to be full, and
      all the blinds are decent&mdash;the two new-comers are newly come down to
      Skull Terrace, and the other blinds are looked up, washed, and fixed up by
      force of example or from very shame&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which seems to have nothing whatever to do with the story, except
      that the scene is down opposite my balcony as I think and smoke, and it is
      a blur on one of the most beautiful harbour views in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been working hard all day, mending the fence, putting up a
      fowl-house and some lattice work and wire netting, and limewashing and
      painting. Labours of love. I&rsquo;d rather build a fowl-house than a &ldquo;pome&rdquo; or
      story, any day. And when finished&mdash;the fowl-house, I mean&mdash;I sit
      and contemplate my handiwork with pure and unadulterated joy. And I take a
      candle out several times, after dark, to look at it again. I never got
      such pleasure out of rhyme, story, or first-class London Academy notice. I
      find it difficult to drag myself from the fowl-house, or whatever it is,
      to meals, and harder to this work, and I lie awake planning next day&rsquo;s
      work until I fall asleep in the sleep of utter happy weariness. And I&rsquo;m up
      and at it, before washing, at daylight. But I was a carpenter and
      housepainter first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it had been a long, close day, and I was very dirty and tired, but
      with the energy and restlessness of healthy, happy tiredness when work is
      unfinished. But I was out of two-inch nails, and the shops were shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it struck me to start up the copper and have a real warm bath after
      my own heart and ideas. The bathroom is outside, next the wash-house and
      copper. There were plenty of splinters and ends of softwood that were mine
      by right of purchase and labour. My landlady is, and always has been,
      sensitive on the subject of firewood. She&rsquo;ll buy anything else to make the
      house comfortable and beautiful. She has been known to buy a piano for one
      of her nieces and burn rubbish in the stove the same day. I knew she was
      uneasy about the softwood odds and ends, but I couldn&rsquo;t help that&mdash;she&rsquo;d
      still be sentimental about them if she had a stack of firewood as big as
      the house. There&rsquo;s at least one thing that most folk hate to buy&mdash;mine&rsquo;s
      boot-laces or bone studs, so long as I can make pins or inked string do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put a bucket of water in the copper, started a fire under that sent
      sparks out of the wash-house flue at an alarming rate, filled the copper
      to the brim, and, in the absence of a lid, covered it with a piece of
      flattened galvanized iron I had.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tacked the side edge of a strip of canvas to the matchboard wall along
      over the inner edge of the bath, fastened a short piece of gas-pipe to the
      outer edge, with pieces of string through holes made in it, and let it
      hang down over the bath, leaving a hole at the head for my head and
      shoulders. I was going to have a long, comfortable, and utterly lazy and
      drowsy hot water and steam bath, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fastened a piece of clothes-line round and over the head of the bath,
      and twisted an old toilet-table cover and a towel round it where it sagged
      into the bath, for a head rest-also to be soaped for where I couldn&rsquo;t get
      at my back with my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to my room for some things, and it struck me to arrange two
      chairs by the bed&mdash;candle and matches and tobacco on one side, and a
      pile of Jack London, Kipling, and Yankee magazines on the other, with the
      last <i>Lone Hand</i> and <i>Bulletin</i> on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going down with pyjamas, towel, and soap, it struck me to have a kettle
      and a saucepan full of water on the stove to use as the water from the
      copper cooled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a roomy, hard-bottomed kitchen chair into the bathroom; on it I
      placed a carefully scraped, cleared, and filled pipe, matches, more
      tobacco, tooth-brush, saucer with a lump of whiting and salt, piece of
      looking-glass&mdash;to see progress of the teeth&mdash;and knife for
      finger and toe nails. And I knocked up a few three-inch iron nails in the
      wall to hang things on. I placed a clean suit of pyjamas over the back of
      the chair, and over them the towels.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arranged with the landlady to have a good cup of coffee made, as she
      knows how to make it, ready to hand in round the edge of the door when I
      should be in the bath. There&rsquo;s nothing in that. I&rsquo;ve been with her for
      years, and on account of the canvas it would be just the same as if I were
      in bed. On second thought I asked her to hand in some toast&mdash;or bread
      and butter and bloater paste&mdash;at the same time. I fed the fire with
      judgment, and the copper boiled just as the last blaze died down. I got a
      pail and carried the water to the bath, pouring it in through the opening
      at the head. The last few pints I dipped into the pail with a cup. I
      covered the opening with a towel to keep the steam and heat in until I was
      ready. I got the boiling water from the kitchen into the bucket, covered
      it with another towel, and stood it in a handy corner in the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made an opening, turned on the cold water, and commenced to undress. I
      hung my clothes on the wall, till morning, for I intended to go straight
      from the bath to bed in my pyjamas and to lie there reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned off the cold water tap to be sure, lifted the towel off, and put
      my good right foot in to feel the temperature&mdash;into about three
      inches of cold water, and that was vanishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;d forgotten to put in the plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m deaf, you know, and the landlady, hearing the water run, thought I was
      flushing out the bath (we were new tenants) and wondered vaguely why I was
      so long at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed rather hurriedly in my working clothes, went inside, and spread
      myself dramatically on the old cane lounge and covered my face with my
      oldest hat, to show that it was comic and I took it that way. But my
      landlady was so full of sympathy, condolence, and self-reproach (because
      she failed to draw my attention to the gurgling) that she let the coffee
      and toast burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up and lay on my bed, and was so tired and misty and far away that
      I went to sleep without undressing, or even washing my face and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many, in this life, forget the plug!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how many, ah! how many, who passed through, and are passing through
      Skull Terrace, commenced life as confidently, carefree, and clear headed,
      and with such easily exercised, careful, intelligent, practised, and
      methodical attention to details as I did the bath business arrangements&mdash;and
      forgot to put in the plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      And many because they were handicapped physically.

    <h2>
      INSTINCT GONE WRONG
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Mac used to sleep in his wagon in fine weather, when he had no load,
      on his blankets spread out on the feed-bags; but one time he struck
      Croydon, flush from a lucky and good back trip, and looked in at the (say)
      Royal Hotel to wet his luck&mdash;as some men do with their sorrow&mdash;and
      he &ldquo;got there all right.&rdquo; Next morning he had breakfast in the
      dining-room, was waited on as a star boarder, and became thoroughly
      demoralized; and his mind was made up (independent of himself, as it were)
      to be a gentleman for once in his life. He went over to the store and
      bought the sloppiest suit of reach-me-downs of glossiest black, and the
      stiffest and stickiest white shirt they had to show&mdash;also four bone
      studs, two for the collar and two for the cuffs. Then he gave his worn
      &ldquo;larstins&rdquo; to the stable-boy (with half a crown) to clean, and&mdash;proceeded.
      He put the boots on during the day, one at a time between drinks, gassing
      all the time, and continued. He concluded about midnight, after a very
      noisy time and interviews with everyone on sight (slightly interrupted by
      drinks) concerning &ldquo;his room.&rdquo; It was show time, you see, and all the
      rooms were as full as he was&mdash;he was too full even to share the
      parlour or billiard room with others; but he consented at last to a
      shake-down on the balcony, the barmaid volunteering to spread the couch
      with her own fair hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards daylight he woke, for one of the reasons why men do wake. It is
      well known, to people who know, that old campers-out (and young men new to
      it, too) will wake <i>once</i>&mdash;if in a party, each at different
      times&mdash;to tend to their cattle, or listen for the hobbles of their
      horses, or simply to rise on their elbows and have a look round&mdash;the
      last, I suppose, from an instinct born in old dangerous times. Mac woke
      up, and it was dark. He reached out and his hand fell, instinctively, on
      the rail of the balcony, which was to him (instinctively&mdash;and that
      shows how instinct errs) the rail of the side of his wagon, in which as I
      have said, he was wont to sleep. So he drew himself up on his knees and to
      his feet, with the instinctive intention of getting down to (say) put some
      chaff and corn in the feed-bags stretched across the shafts for the
      horses; for he intended, by instinct, to make an early start. Which shows
      how instinct can never be trusted to travel with memory, but will get
      ahead of it&mdash;or behind it. (Say it was instinct mixed with or
      adulterated by drink.) He got a long, hairy leg over and felt
      (instinctively) for the hub of the wheel; his foot found and rested on the
      projecting ledge of the balcony floor outside, and that, to him, was the
      hub all right. He swung his other leg over and expected to drop lightly on
      to the grass or dust of the camp; but, being instinctively rigid, he fell
      heavily some fifteen feet into a kerbed gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of his howls lights soon flickered in windows and fanlights;
      and with prompt, eager, anxious, and awed bush first-aid and assistance,
      they carried a very sober, battered and blasphemous driver inside and
      spread mattresses on the floor. And, some six weeks afterwards, an image,
      mostly of plaster-of-Paris and bandages, reclined, much against its will,
      on a be-cushioned cane lounge on the hospital veranda; and, from the only
      free and workable corner of its mouth, when the pipe was removed, came
      shockingly expressed opinions of them&mdash;newfangled&mdash;two-story&mdash;!
      &ldquo;night houses&rdquo; (as it called them). And, thereafter, when he had a load
      on, or the weather was too bad for sleeping in or under his wagon, the
      veranda of a one-storied shanty (if he could get to it) was good enough
      for MacSomething, the carrier.

    <h2>
      THE HYPNOTIZED TOWNSHIP
    </h2>
    <p>
      They said that Harry Chatswood, the mail contractor would do anything for
      Cobb &amp; Co., even to stretching fencing-wire across the road in a
      likely place: but I don&rsquo;t believe that&mdash;Harry was too good-hearted to
      risk injuring innocent passengers, and he had a fellow feeling for
      drivers, being an old coach driver on rough out-back tracks himself. But
      he did rig up fencing-wire for old Mac, the carrier, one night, though not
      across the road. Harry, by the way, was a city-born bushman, who had been
      everything for some years. Anything from six-foot-six to six-foot-nine,
      fourteen stone, and a hard case. He is a very successful coach-builder
      now, for he knows the wood, the roads, and the weak parts in a coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the good seasons when competition was keen and men&rsquo;s hearts were
      hard&mdash;not as it is in times of drought, when there is no competition,
      and men&rsquo;s hearts are soft, and there is all kindness and goodwill between
      them. He had had much opposition in fighting Cobb &amp; Co., and his
      coaches had won through on the outer tracks. There was little malice in
      his composition, but when old Mac, the teamster, turned his teams over to
      his sons and started a light van for parcels and passengers from
      Cunnamulla&mdash;that place which always sounds to me suggestive of
      pumpkin pies&mdash;out in seeming opposition to Harry Chatswood, Harry was
      annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Mac only wished to end his days on the road with parcels that were
      light and easy to handle (not like loads of fencing wire) and passengers
      that were sociable; but he had been doing well with his teams, and,
      besides, Harry thought he was after the mail contract: so Harry was
      annoyed more than he was injured. Mac was mean with the money he had not
      because of the money he had a chance of getting; and he mostly slept in
      his van, in all weathers, when away from home which was kept by his wife
      about half-way between the half-way house and the next &ldquo;township.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One dark, gusty evening, Harry Chatswood&rsquo;s coach dragged, heavily though
      passengerless, into Cunnamulla, and, as he turned into the yard of the
      local &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo; he saw Mac&rsquo;s tilted four-wheeler (which he called his
      &ldquo;van&rdquo;) drawn up opposite by the kerbing round the post office. Mac always
      chose a central position&mdash;with a vague idea of advertisement perhaps.
      But the nearness to the P.O. reminded Harry of the mail contracts, and he
      knew that Mac had taken up a passenger or two and some parcels in front of
      him (Harry) on the trip in. And something told Harry that Mac was asleep
      inside his van. It was a windy night, with signs of rain, and the curtains
      were drawn close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mac was there all right, and sleeping the sleep of a tired driver
      after a long drowsy day on a hard box-seat, with little or no back railing
      to it. But there was a lecture on, or an exhibition of hypnotism or
      mesmerism&mdash;&ldquo;a blanky spirit rappin&rsquo; fake,&rdquo; they called it, run by
      &ldquo;some blanker&rdquo; in &ldquo;the hall;&rdquo; and when old Mac had seen to his horses, he
      thought he might as well drop in for half an hour and see what was going
      on. Being a Mac, he was, of course, theological, scientific, and
      argumentative. He saw some things which woke him up, challenged the
      performer to hypnotize him, was &ldquo;operated&rdquo; on or &ldquo;fooled with&rdquo; a bit, had
      a &ldquo;numb sorter light-headed feelin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and was told by a voice from the
      back of the hall that his &ldquo;leg was being pulled, Mac,&rdquo; and by another
      buzzin&rsquo; far-away kind of &ldquo;ventrillick&rdquo; voice that he would make a good
      subject, and that, if he only had the will power and knew how (which he
      would learn from a book the professor had to sell for five shillings) he
      would be able to drive his van without horses or any thing, save the pole
      sticking straight out in front. These weren&rsquo;t the professor&rsquo;s exact words&mdash;But,
      anyway, Mae came to himself with a sudden jerk, left with a great Scottish
      snort of disgust and the sound of heavy boots along the floor; and after a
      resentful whisky at the Royal, where they laughed at his scrooging bushy
      eyebrows, fierce black eyes and his deadly-in-earnest denunciation of all
      humbugs and imposters, he returned to the aforesaid van, let down the
      flaps, buttoned the daft and &ldquo;feekle&rdquo; world out, and himself in, and then
      retired some more and slept, as I have said, rolled in his blankets and
      overcoats on a bed of cushions, and chaff-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Chatswood got down from his empty coach, and was helping the yard
      boy take out the horses, when his eye fell on the remnant of a roll of
      fencing wire standing by the stable wall in the light of the lantern. Then
      an idea struck him unexpectedly, and his mind became luminous. He unhooked
      the swinglebar, swung it up over his &ldquo;leader&rsquo;s&rdquo; rump (he was driving only
      three horses that trip), and hooked it on to the horns of the hames. Then
      he went inside (there was another light there) and brought out a bridle
      and an old pair of spurs that were hanging on the wall. He buckled on the
      spurs at the chopping block, slipped the winkers off the leader and the
      bridle on, and took up the fencing-wire, and started out the gate with the
      horse. The boy gaped after him once, and then hurried to put up the other
      two horses. He knew Harry Chatswood, and was in a hurry to see what he
      would be up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good crowd in town for the show, or the races, or a stock
      sale, or land ballot, or something; but most of them were tired, or at tea&mdash;or
      in the pubs&mdash;and the corners were deserted. Observe how fate makes
      time and things fit when she wants to do a good turn&mdash;or play a
      practical joke. Harry Chatswood, for instance, didn&rsquo;t know anything about
      the hypnotic business.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the corners of the main street or road and the principal short
      cross street, and the van was opposite the pub stables in the main street.
      Harry crossed the streets diagonally to the opposite corner, in a line
      with the van. There he slipped the bar down over the horse&rsquo;s rump, and
      fastened one end of the wire on to the ring of it. Then he walked back to
      the van, carrying the wire and letting the coils go wide, and, as
      noiselessly as possible, made a loop in the loose end and slipped it over
      the hooks on the end of the pole. (&ldquo;Unnecessary detail!&rdquo; my contemporaries
      will moan, &ldquo;Overloaded with uninteresting details!&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s because
      they haven&rsquo;t got the details&mdash;and it&rsquo;s the details that go.) Then
      Harry skipped back to his horse, jumped on, gathered up the bridle reins,
      and used his spurs. There was a swish and a clang, a scrunch and a
      clock-clock and rattle of wheels, and a surprised human sound; then a bump
      and a shout&mdash;for there was no underground drainage, and the gutters
      belonged to the Stone Age. There was a swift clocking and rattle, more
      shouts, another bump, and a yell. And so on down the longish main street.
      The stable-boy, who had left the horses in his excitement, burst into the
      bar, shouting, &ldquo;The Hypnertism&rsquo;s on, the Mesmerism&rsquo;s on! Ole Mae&rsquo;s van&rsquo;s
      runnin&rsquo; away with him without no horses all right!&rdquo; The crowd scuffled out
      into the street; there were some unfortunate horses hanging up of course
      at the panel by the pub trough, and the first to get to them jumped on and
      rode; the rest ran. The hall&mdash;where they were clearing the willing
      professor out in favour of a &ldquo;darnce&rdquo;&mdash;and the other pubs decanted
      their contents, and chance souls skipped for the verandas of weather-board
      shanties out of which other souls popped to see the runaway. They saw a
      weird horseman, or rather, something like a camel (for Harry rode low,
      like Tod Sloan with his long back humped&mdash;for effect)&mdash;apparently
      fleeing for its life in a veil of dust, along the long white road, and
      some forty rods behind, an unaccountable tilted coach careered in its own
      separate cloud of dust. And from it came the shouts and yells. Men shouted
      and swore, women screamed for their children, and kids whimpered. Some of
      the men turned with an oath and stayed the panic with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one of them flamin&rsquo; motor-cars, you fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have been, and the yells the warning howls of a motorist who had
      burst or lost his honk-kook and his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; away!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The toff&rsquo;s mad or drunk!&rdquo; shouted others. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
      break its crimson back over the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it!&rdquo; was the verdict of some. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the crimson carnal things are
      good for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the riders still rode and the footmen ran. There was a clatter of
      hoofs on the short white bridge looming ghostly ahead, and then, at a
      weird interval, the rattle and rumble of wheels, with no hoof-beats
      accompanying. The yells grew fainter. Harry&rsquo;s leader was a good horse, of
      the rather heavy coachhorse breed, with a little of the racing blood in
      her, but she was tired to start with, and only excitement and fright at
      the feel of the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; of the twisting wire kept her up to that speed; and
      now she was getting winded, so half a mile or so beyond the bridge Harry
      thought it had gone far enough, and he stopped and got down. The van ran
      on a bit, of course, and the loop of the wire slipped off the hooks of the
      pole. The wire recoiled itself roughly along the dust nearly to the heels
      of Harry&rsquo;s horse. Harry grabbed up as much of the wire as he could claw
      for, took the mare by the neck with the other hand, and vanished through
      the dense fringe of scrub off the road, till the wire caught and pulled
      him up; he stood still for a moment, in the black shadow on the edge of a
      little clearing, to listen. Then he fumbled with the wire until he got it
      untwisted, cast it off, and moved off silently with the mare across the
      soft rotten ground, and left her in a handy bush stockyard, to be brought
      back to the stables at a late hour that night&mdash;or rather an early
      hour next morning&mdash;by a jackaroo stable-boy who would have two
      half-crowns in his pocket and afterthought instructions to look out for
      that wire and hide it if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Harry Chatswood got back quickly, by a roundabout way, and walked
      into the bar of the Royal, through the back entrance from the stables, and
      stared, and wanted to know where all the chaps had gone to, and what the
      noise was about, and whose trap had run away, and if anybody was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing crowd gathered round the van, silent and awestruck, and some
      of them threw off their hats, and lost them, in their anxiety to show
      respect for the dead, or render assistance to the hurt, as men do, round a
      bad accident in the bush. They got the old man out, and two of them helped
      him back along the road, with great solicitude, while some walked round
      the van, and swore beneath their breaths, or stared at it with open
      mouths, or examined it curiously, with their eyes only, and in breathless
      silence. They muttered, and agreed, in the pale moonlight now showing,
      that the sounds of the horses&rsquo; hoofs had only been &ldquo;spirit-rappin&rsquo; 
      sounds;&rdquo; and, after some more muttering, two of the stoutest, with subdued
      oaths, laid hold of the pole and drew the van to the side of the road,
      where it would be out of the way of chance night traffic. But they
      stretched and rubbed their arms afterwards, and then, and on the way back,
      they swore to admiring acquaintances that they felt the &ldquo;blanky
      &lsquo;lectricity&rdquo; runnin&rsquo; all up their arms and &ldquo;elbers&rdquo; while they were
      holding the pole, which, doubtless, they did&mdash;in imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got old Mac back to the Royal, with sundry hasty whiskies on the way.
      He was badly shaken, both physically, mentally, and in his convictions,
      and, when he&rsquo;d pulled himself together, he had little to add to what they
      already knew. But he confessed that, when he got under his possum rug in
      the van, he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the professor and his creepy (it was
      &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; or &ldquo;awful,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rum&rdquo; with &lsquo;em now)&mdash;his
      blanky creepy hypnotism; and he (old Mac) had just laid on his back
      comfortable, and stretched his legs out straight, and his arms down
      straight by his sides, and drew long, slow breaths; and tried to fix his
      mind on nothing&mdash;as the professor had told him when he was &ldquo;operatin&rsquo; 
      on him&rdquo; in the hall. Then he began to feel a strange sort of numbness
      coming over him, and his limbs went heavy as lead, and he seemed to be
      gettin&rsquo; light-headed. Then, all on a sudden, his arms seemed to begin to
      lift, and just when he was goin&rsquo; to pull &lsquo;em down the van started as they
      had heard and seen it. After a while he got on to his knees and managed to
      wrench a corner; of the front curtain clear of the button and get his head
      out. And there was the van going helter-skelter, and feeling like Tam
      o&rsquo;Shanter&rsquo;s mare (the old man said), and he on her barebacked. And there
      was no horses, but a cloud of dust&mdash;or a spook&mdash;on ahead, and
      the bare pole steering straight for it, just as the professor had said it
      would be. The old man thought he was going to be taken clear across the
      Never-Never country and left to roast on a sandhill, hundreds of miles
      from anywhere, for his sins, and he said he was trying to think of a
      prayer or two all the time he was yelling. They handed him more whisky
      from the publican&rsquo;s own bottle. Hushed and cautious inquiries for the
      Professor (with a big P now) elicited the hushed and cautious fact that he
      had gone to bed. But old Mac caught the awesome name and glared round, so
      they hurriedly filled out another for him, from the boss&rsquo;s bottle. Then
      there was a slight commotion. The housemaid hurried scaredly in to the bar
      behind and whispered to the boss. She had been startled nearly out of her
      wits by the Professor suddenly appearing at his bedroom door and calling
      upon her to have a stiff nobbler of whisky hot sent up to his room. The
      jackaroo yard-boy, aforesaid, volunteered to take it up, and while he was
      gone there were hints of hysterics from the kitchen, and the boss
      whispered in his turn to the crowd over the bar. The jackaroo just handed
      the tray and glass in through the partly opened door, had a glimpse of
      pyjamas, and, after what seemed an interminable wait, he came tiptoeing
      into the bar amongst its awe-struck haunters with an air of great mystery,
      and no news whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fixed old Mac on a shake-down in the Commercial Room, where he&rsquo;d have
      light and some overflow guests on the sofas for company. With a last
      whisky in the bar, and a stiff whisky by his side on the floor, he was
      understood to chuckle to the effect that he knew he was all right when
      he&rsquo;d won &ldquo;the keystone o&rsquo; the brig.&rdquo; Though how a wooden bridge with a
      level plank floor could have a keystone I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and they were
      too much impressed by the event of the evening to inquire. And so, with a
      few cases of hysterics to occupy the attention of the younger women, some
      whimpering of frightened children and comforting or chastened nagging by
      mothers, some unwonted prayers muttered secretly and forgettingly, and a
      good deal of subdued blasphemy, Cunnamulla sank to its troubled slumbers&mdash;some
      of the sleepers in the commercial and billiard-rooms and parlours at the
      Royal, to start up in a cold sweat, out of their beery and hypnotic
      nightmares, to find Harry Chatswood making elaborate and fearsome passes
      over them with his long, gaunt arms and hands, and a flaming red
      table-cloth tied round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be done with old Mac, for the present. He made one or two more trips,
      but always by daylight, taking care to pick up a swagman or a tramp when
      he had no passenger; but his &ldquo;conveections&rdquo; had had too much of a shaking,
      so he sold his turnout (privately and at a distance, for it was beginning
      to be called &ldquo;the haunted van&rdquo;) and returned to his teams&mdash;always
      keeping one of the lads with him for company. He reckoned it would take
      the devil&rsquo;s own hypnotism to move a load of fencingwire, or pull a
      wool-team of bullocks out of a bog; and before he invoked the ungodly
      power, which he let them believe he could&mdash;he&rsquo;d stick there and
      starve till he and his bullocks died a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; death. (He was a bit
      Irish&mdash;as all Scots are&mdash;back on one side.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But the strangest is to come. The Professor, next morning, proved
      uncomfortably unsociable, and though he could have done a roaring business
      that night&mdash;and for a week of nights after, for that matter&mdash;and
      though he was approached several times, he, for some mysterious reason
      known only to himself, flatly refused to give one more performance, and
      said he was leaving the town that day. He couldn&rsquo;t get a vehicle of any
      kind, for fear, love, or money, until Harry Chatswood, who took a day off,
      volunteered, for a stiff consideration, to borrow a buggy and drive him
      (the Professor) to the next town towards the then railway terminus, in
      which town the Professor&rsquo;s fame was not so awesome, and where he might get
      a lift to the railway. Harry ventured to remark to the Professor once or
      twice during the drive that &ldquo;there was a rum business with old Mac&rsquo;s van
      last night,&rdquo; but he could get nothing out of him, so gave it best, and
      finished the journey in contemplative silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the fact was that the Professor had been the most surprised and
      startled man in Cunnamulla that night; and he brooded over the thing till
      he came to the conclusion that hypnotism was a dangerous power to meddle
      with unless a man was physically and financially strong and carefree&mdash;which
      he wasn&rsquo;t. So he threw it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learnt the truth, some years later, from a brother of Harry Chatswood,
      in a Home or Retreat for Geniuses, where &ldquo;friends were paying,&rdquo; and his
      recovery was so sudden that it surprised and disappointed the doctor and
      his friend, the manager of the home. As it was, the Professor had some
      difficulty in getting out of it.

    <h2>
      THE EXCISEMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry Chatswood, mail contractor (and several other things), was driving
      out from, say, Georgeville to Croydon, with mails, parcels, and only one
      passenger&mdash;a commercial traveller, who had shown himself unsociable,
      and close in several other ways. Nearly half-way to a place that was
      half-way between the halfway house and the town, Harry overhauled &ldquo;Old
      Jack,&rdquo; a local character (there are many well-known characters named &ldquo;Old
      Jack&rdquo;) and gave him a lift as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Is that you, Jack?&rdquo; in the gathering dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then jump up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry was good-natured and would give anybody a lift if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jack climbed up on the box-seat, between Harry and the traveller, who
      grew rather more stand&mdash;(or rather <i>sit</i>) offish, wrapped
      himself closer in his overcoat, and buttoned his cloak of silence and
      general disgust to the chin button. Old Jack got his pipe to work and
      grunted, and chatted, and exchanged bush compliments with Harry
      comfortably. And so on to where they saw the light of a fire outside a hut
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me down here, Harry,&rdquo; said Old Jack uneasily, &ldquo;I owe Mother Mac
      fourteen shillings for drinks, and I haven&rsquo;t got it on me, and I&rsquo;ve been
      on the spree back yonder, and she&rsquo;ll know it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to face
      her. I&rsquo;ll cut across through the paddock and you can pick me up on the
      other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry thought a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted and went down into his trouser-pocket, the reins in one hand,
      and brought up a handful of silver. He held his hand down to the coach
      lamp, separated some of the silver from the rest by a sort of sleight of
      hand&mdash;or rather sleight of fingers&mdash;and handed the fourteen
      shillings over to Old Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, Jack. Pay me some other time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Harry!&rdquo; grunted Old Jack, as he twisted for his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold night, the hint of a possible shanty thawed the traveller a
      bit, and he relaxed with a couple of grunts about the weather and the
      road, which were received in a brotherly spirit. Harry&rsquo;s horses stopped of
      their own accord in front of the house, an old bark-and-slab whitewashed
      humpy of the early settlers&rsquo; farmhouse type, with a plank door in the
      middle, one bleary-lighted window on one side, and one forbiddingly blind
      one, as if death were there, on the other. It might have been. The door
      opened, letting out a flood of lamp-light and firelight which blindly
      showed the sides of the coach and the near pole horse and threw the coach
      lamps and the rest into the outer darkness of the opposing bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Harry?&rdquo; called a voice and tone like Mrs Warren&rsquo;s of the
      Profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stoutly aggressive woman appeared. She was rather florid, and looked,
      moved and spoke as if she had been something in the city in other years,
      and had been dumped down in the bush to make money in mysterious ways; had
      married, mated&mdash;or got herself to be supposed to be married&mdash;for
      convenience, and continued to make money by mysterious means. Anyway, she
      was &ldquo;Mother Mac&rdquo; to the bush, but, in the bank in the &ldquo;town,&rdquo; and in the
      stores where she dealt, she was <i>Mrs</i> Mac, and there was always a
      promptly propped chair for her. She was, indeed, the missus of no other
      than old Mac, the teamster of hypnotic fame, and late opposition to Harry
      Chatswood. Hence, perhaps, part of Harry&rsquo;s hesitation to pull up, farther
      back, and his generosity to Old Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs or Mother Mac sold refreshments, from a rough bush dinner at
      eighteenpence a head to passengers, to a fly-blown bottle of ginger-ale or
      lemonade, hot in hot weather from a sunny fly-specked window. In between
      there was cold corned beef, bread and butter, and tea, and (best of all if
      they only knew it) a good bush billy of coffee on the coals before the
      fire on cold wet nights. And outside of it all, there was cold tea, which,
      when confidence was established, or they knew one of the party, she served
      hushedly in cups without saucers; for which she sometimes apologized, and
      which she took into her murderous bedroom to fill, and replenish, in its
      darkest and most felonious corner from homicidal-looking pots, by
      candle-light. You&rsquo;d think you were in a cheap place, where you shouldn&rsquo;t
      be, in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry and his passengers got down and stretched their legs, and while Old
      Jack was guardedly answering a hurriedly whispered inquiry of the
      traveller, Harry took the opportunity to nudge Mrs Mac, and whisper in her
      ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Mrs Mac!&mdash;Exciseman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil he is!&rdquo; whispered she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-e-es!&rdquo; whispered Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Harry!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Never a word! I&rsquo;ll take care of him,
      bless his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a warm at the wide wood fire, a gulp of coffee and a bite or two at
      the bread and meat, the traveller, now thoroughly thawed, stretched
      himself and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, Mrs Mac, haven&rsquo;t you got anything else to offer us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what more would you be wanting?&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the bread and
      meat good enough for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo; he suggested lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know?&mdash;I know!&mdash;What do <i>I</i> know?&rdquo; A pause, then, with
      startling suddenness, &ldquo;Phwat d&rsquo;y&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offence, Mrs Mac&mdash;no offence; but haven&rsquo;t you got something in
      the way of&mdash;of a drink to offer us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dhrink! Isn&rsquo;t the coffee good enough for ye? I paid two and six a pound
      for ut, and the milk new from the cow this very evenin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; th&rsquo; 
      water rain-water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you know what I mean, Mrs Mac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; I doan&rsquo;t know what ye mean. <i>Phwat do ye mean</i>? I&rsquo;ve asked ye
      that before. What are ye dhrivin&rsquo; at, man&mdash;out with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I mean a little drop of the right stuff,&rdquo; he said, nettled. Then he
      added: &ldquo;No offence&mdash;no harm done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-oh!&rdquo; she said, illumination bursting in upon her brain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      dirrty drink ye&rsquo;re afther, is it? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ye, first for last, that
      we doan&rsquo;t keep a little drop of the right stuff nor a little drop of the
      wrong stuff in this house. It&rsquo;s a honest house, an&rsquo; me husband&rsquo;s a honest
      harrd-worrkin&rsquo; carrier, as he&rsquo;d soon let ye know if he was at home this
      cold night, poor man. No dirrty drink comes into this house, nor goes out
      of it, I&rsquo;d have ye know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, Mrs Mac, between friends, I meant no offence; but it&rsquo;s a cold
      night, and I thought you might keep a bottle for medicine&mdash;or in case
      of accident&mdash;or snake-bite, you know&mdash;they mostly do in the
      bush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicine! And phwat should we want with medicine? This isn&rsquo;t a
      five-guinea private hospital. We&rsquo;re clean, healthy people, I&rsquo;d have ye
      know. There&rsquo;s a bottle of painkiller, if that&rsquo;s what ye want, and a packet
      of salts left&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;d do ye some good. An&rsquo; a bottle of
      eye-water, an&rsquo; something to put in your ear for th&rsquo; earache&mdash;maybe
      ye&rsquo;ll want &lsquo;em both before ye go much farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mrs Mac&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no more of it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I tell ye that if it&rsquo;s a nip ye&rsquo;re afther,
      ye&rsquo;ll have to go on fourteen miles to the pub in the town. Ye&rsquo;re coffee&rsquo;s
      gittin&rsquo; cowld, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s eighteenpence each to passengers I charge on a
      night like this; Harry Chatswood&rsquo;s the driver an&rsquo; welcome, an&rsquo; Ould Jack&rsquo;s
      an ould friend.&rdquo; And she flounced round to clatter her feelings amongst
      the crockery on the dresser&mdash;just as men make a great show of filling
      and lighting their pipes in the middle of a barney. The table, by the way,
      was set on a brown holland cloth, with the brightest of tin plates for
      cold meals, and the brightest of tin pint-pots for the coffee (the
      crockery was in reserve for hot meals and special local occasions) and at
      one side of the wide fire-place hung an old-fashioned fountain, while in
      the other stood a camp-oven; and billies and a black kerosene-tin hung
      evermore over the fire from sooty chains. These, and a big bucket-handled
      frying-pan and a few rusty convict-time arms on the slab walls, were
      mostly to amuse jackaroos and jackarooesses, and let them think they were
      getting into the Australian-dontcherknow at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Chatswood took the opportunity (he had a habit of taking
      opportunities of this sort) to whisper to Old Jack:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay her the fourteen bob, Jack, and have done with it. She&rsquo;s got the
      needle to-night all right, and damfiknow what for. But the sight of your
      fourteen bob might bring her round.&rdquo; And Old Jack&mdash;as was his way&mdash;blundered
      obediently and promptly right into the hole that was shown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs Mae,&rdquo; he said, getting up from the table and slipping his hand
      into his pocket. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over yer to-night, but, anyway&mdash;&rdquo;
       Here he put the money down on the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money I owe yer for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; she demanded, turning on him with surprising swiftness for
      such a stout woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the fourteen bob I owed for them drinks when Bill Hogan and me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me no fourteen bob for dhrinks, you dirty blaggard! Are ye
      mad? You got no drink off of me. Phwat d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg&mdash;beg pardin, Mrs Mac,&rdquo; stammered Old Jack, very much taken
      aback; &ldquo;but the&mdash;yer know&mdash;the fourteen bob, anyway, I owed you
      when&mdash;that night when me an&rsquo; Bill Hogan an&rsquo; yer sister-in-law, Mary
      Don&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Well, I&mdash;Git out of me house, ye low blaggard! I&rsquo;m a honest,
      respictable married woman, and so is me sister-in-law, Mary Donelly; and
      to think!&mdash;Git out of me door!&rdquo; and she caught up the billy of
      coffee. &ldquo;Git outside me door, or I&rsquo;ll let ye have it in ye&rsquo;r ugly face, ye
      low woolscourer&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nearly bilin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Jack stumbled dazedly out, and blind instinct got him on to the coach
      as the safest place. Harry Chatswood had stood with his long, gaunt figure
      hung by an elbow to the high mantelshelf, all the time, taking alternate
      gulps from his pint of coffee and puffs from his pipe, and very calmly and
      restfully regarding the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the <i>gentleman&rsquo;s</i> done, I&rsquo;d thank him to pay&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      eighteenpence&mdash;an&rsquo; git his overcoat on. I&rsquo;ve had enough dirty insults
      this night to last me a lifetime. To think of it&mdash;the blaggard!&rdquo; she
      said to the table, &ldquo;an&rsquo; me a woman alone in a place like this on a night
      like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The traveller calmly put down a two-shilling piece, as if the whole affair
      was the most ordinary thing in the world (for he was used to many bush
      things) and comfortably got into his overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs Mae, I never thought Old Jack was mad before,&rdquo; said Harry
      Chatswood. &ldquo;And I hinted to him,&rdquo; he added in a whisper. &ldquo;Anyway&rdquo; (out
      loudly), &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll lend me a light, Mrs Mac, to have a look at that there
      swingle-bar of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re a white man, anyway. I&rsquo;ll
      bring ye a light. An&rsquo; all the lights in heaven if I could, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      in the other place if they&rsquo;d help ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he&rsquo;d looked to the swingle-bar, and had mounted to his place and
      untwisted the reins from a side-bar, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; as for them two, Harry, shpill them in the first creek you come to,
      an&rsquo; God be good to you! It&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re fit for, the low blaggards, to
      insult an honest woman alone in the bush in a place like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mrs Mac,&rdquo; said Harry, cheerfully. &ldquo;Good night, Mrs Mac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Harry, an&rsquo; God go with ye, for the creeks are risen after
      last night&rsquo;s storm.&rdquo; And Harry drove on and left her to think over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought over it in a way that would have been unexpected to Harry, and
      would have made him uneasy, for he was really good-natured. She sat down
      on a stool by the fire, and presently, after thinking over it a bit, two
      big, lonely tears rolled down the lonely woman&rsquo;s fair, fat, blonde cheeks
      in the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; to think of Old Jack,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The very last man in the world I&rsquo;d
      dreamed of turning on me. But&mdash;but I always thought Old Jack was
      goin&rsquo; a bit ratty, an&rsquo; maybe I was a bit hard on him. God forgive us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Harry Chatswood seen her then he would have been sorry he did it.
      Swagmen and broken-hearted new chums had met worse women than Mother Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she pulled herself together, got up and bustled round. She put on more
      wood, swept the hearth, put a parcel of fresh steak and sausages&mdash;brought
      by the coach&mdash;on to a clean plate on the table, and got some potatoes
      into a dish; for Chatswood had told her that her first and longest and
      favourite stepson was not far behind him with the bullock team. Before she
      had finished the potatoes she heard the clock-clock of heavy wheels and
      the crack of the bullock whip coming along the dark bush track.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very next morning a man riding back from Croydon called, and stuck
      his head under the veranda eaves with a bush greeting, and she told him
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He straightened up, and tickled the back of his head with his little
      finger, and gaped at her for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t no excise officer. I know him well&mdash;I
      was drinking with him at the Royal last night afore we went to bed, an&rsquo; 
      had a nip with him this morning afore we started. Why! that&rsquo;s Bobby
      Howell, Burns and Bridges&rsquo; traveller, an&rsquo; a good sort when he wakes up,
      an&rsquo; willin&rsquo; with the money when he does good biz, especially when there&rsquo;s
      a chanst of a drink on a long road on a dark night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Harry Chatswood again! The infernal villain,&rdquo; she cried, with a jerk
      of her arm. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be even with him, the dirrty blaggard. An&rsquo; to think&mdash;I
      always knew Old Jack was a white man an&rsquo;&mdash;to think! There&rsquo;s fourteen
      shillin&rsquo;s gone that Old Jack would have paid me, an&rsquo; the traveller was
      good for three shillin&rsquo;s f&rsquo;r the nips, an&rsquo;&mdash;but Old Jack will pay me
      next time, and I&rsquo;ll be even with Harry Chatswood, the dirrty mail carter.
      I&rsquo;ll take it out of him in parcels&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be even with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never saw Old Jack again with fourteen shillings, but she got even
      with Harry Chatswood, and&mdash;But I&rsquo;ll tell you about that some other
      time. Time for a last smoke before we turn in.

    <h2>
      MATESHIP IN SHAKESPEARE&rsquo;S ROME
    </h2>
    <p>
      How we do misquote sayings, or misunderstand them when quoted rightly! For
      instance, we &ldquo;wait for something to turn up, like Micawber,&rdquo; careless or
      ignorant of the fact that Micawber worked harder than all the rest put
      together for the leading characters&rsquo; sakes; he was the chief or only
      instrument in straightening out of the sadly mixed state of things&mdash;and
      he held his tongue till the time came. Moreover&mdash;and &ldquo;<i>Put a pin in
      that spot, young man</i>,&rdquo; as Dr &ldquo;Yark&rdquo; used to say&mdash;when there came
      a turn in the tide of the affairs of Micawber, he took it at the flood,
      and it led on to fortune. He became a hardworking settler, a pioneer&mdash;a
      respected early citizen and magistrate in this bright young Commonwealth
      of ours, my masters!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, by the way, and strictly between you and me, I have a shrewd
      suspicion that Uriah Heep wasn&rsquo;t the only cad in David Copperfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutus, the originator of the saying, took the tide at the flood, and it
      led him and his friends on to death, or&mdash;well, perhaps, under the
      circumstances, it was all the same to Brutus and his old mate, Cassius.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    And this, my masters, brings me home,
    Bush-born bard, to Ancient Rome.
</pre>
    <p>
      And there&rsquo;s little difference in the climate, or the men&mdash;save in the
      little matter of ironmongery&mdash;and no difference at all in the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;ll pass over the accident that happened to Caesar. Such accidents had
      happened to great and little Caesars hundreds of times before, and have
      happened many times since, and will happen until the end of time, both in
      &ldquo;sport&rdquo; (in plays) and in earnest:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius:  ....How many ages hence
            Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
            In states unborn and accents yet unknown?

    Brutus: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
            That now at Pompey&rsquo;s basis lies along
            No worthier than the dust!
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare hadn&rsquo;t Australia and George Rignold in his mind&rsquo;s eye when he
      wrote that.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius: So oft as that shall be,
             So often shall the knot of us be call&rsquo;d
             The men that gave their country liberty.
</pre>
    <p>
      Well, be that as it will, I&rsquo;m with Brutus too, irrespective of the merits
      of the case. Antony spoke at the funeral, with free and generous
      permission, and see what he made of it. And why shouldn&rsquo;t I? and see what
      I&rsquo;ll make of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antony, after sending abject and uncalled-for surrender, and grovelling
      unasked in the dust to Brutus and his friends as no straight mate should
      do for another, dead or alive&mdash;and after taking the blood-stained
      hands of his alleged friend&rsquo;s murderers&mdash;got permission to speak. To
      speak for his own ends or that paltry, selfish thing called &ldquo;revenge,&rdquo; be
      it for one&rsquo;s self or one&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brutus, I want a word with you,&rdquo; whispered Cassius. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him speak!
      You don&rsquo;t know how he might stir up the mob with what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Brutus had already given his word:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Antony: That&rsquo;s all I seek:
            And am moreover suitor that I may
            Produce his body to the market place,
            And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
            Speak in the order of his funeral.

    Brutus: You shall, Mark Antony.
</pre>
    <p>
      And now, strong in his right, as he thinks, and trusting to the honour of
      Antony, he only stipulates that he (Brutus) shall go on to the platform
      first and explain things; and that Antony shall speak all the good he can
      of Caesar, but not abuse Brutus and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Antony (mark you) agrees and promises and breaks his promise
      immediately afterwards. Maybe he was only gaining time for his good friend
      Octavius Caesar, but time gained by such foul means is time lost through
      all eternity. Did Mark think of these things years afterwards in Egypt
      when he was doubly ruined and doubly betrayed to his good friend Octavius
      by that hot, jealous, selfish, shallow, shifty, strumpet, Cleopatra, and
      Octavius was after his scalp with a certainty of getting it? He did&mdash;and
      he spoke of it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutus made his speech, a straightforward, manly speech in prose, and the
      gist of the matter was that he did what he did (killed Caesar), not
      because he loved Caesar less, but because he loved Rome more. And I
      believe he told the simple honest truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he acts as Antony&rsquo;s chairman, or introducer, in a manly
      straightforward manner, and then he goes off and leaves the stage to him,
      which is another generous act; though it was lucky for Brutus, as it
      happened afterwards, that he was out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Antony gets all the limelight and blank verse. He had the &ldquo;gift of
      the gab&rdquo; all right. Old Cassius referred to it later on in one of those
      &ldquo;words-before-blows&rdquo; barneys they had on the battlefield where they hurt
      each other a damned sight more with their tongues than they did with their
      swords afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;ve all heard of Antony&rsquo;s speech:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
</pre>
    <p>
      Which was a lie to start with.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       The evil that men do lives after them,
       The good is oft interred with their bones.
</pre>
    <p>
      Which is not so true in these days of newspapers and magazines. And so on.
      He says that Brutus and his friends are honourable men about nine times in
      his short speech. Now, was Mark Antony an honourable man?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the flap-doodle about dead Caesar&rsquo;s wounds, and their poor dumb
      mouths, and the people kissing them, and dipping their handkerchiefs in
      his sacred blood. All worthy of our Purves trying to pump tears out of a
      jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it fetched the crowd; it always did, it always has done, it always
      does, and it always will do. And the hint of Caesar&rsquo;s will, and the open
      abuse of Brutus and Co. when he saw that he was safe, and the cheap
      anti-climax of the reading of the will. Nothing in this line can be too
      cheap for the crowd, as witness the melodramas of our own civilized and
      enlightened times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antony was a noble Purves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the mob rushed off to burn houses, as it has always done, and will
      always do when it gets a chance&mdash;it tried to burn mine more than
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quarrel scene between Brutus and Cassius is one of the best scenes in
      Shakespeare. It is great from the sublime to the ridiculous&mdash;you must
      read it for yourself. It seems that Brutus objected to Cassius&rsquo;s, or one
      of his off-side friends&rsquo; methods of raising the wind&mdash;he reckoned it
      was one of the very things they killed Julius Caesar for; and Cassius,
      loving Brutus more than a brother, is very much hurt about it. I can&rsquo;t
      make out what the trouble really was about and I don&rsquo;t suppose either
      Cassius or Brutus was clear as to what it was all about either. It&rsquo;s
      generally the way when friends fall out. It seems also that Brutus thinks
      that Cassius refused to lend him a few quid to pay his legions, and, you
      know, it&rsquo;s an unpardonable crime for one mate to refuse another a few quid
      when he&rsquo;s in a hole; but it seems that the messenger was but a fool who
      brought Cassius&rsquo;s answer back. It is generally the messenger who is to
      blame, when friends make it up after a quarrel that was all their own
      fault. Messengers had an uncomfortable time in those days, as witness the
      case of the base slave who had to bring Cleopatra the news of Antony&rsquo;s
      marriage with Octavia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the quarrel scene is great for its deep knowledge of the hearts of men
      in matters of man to man&mdash;of man friend to man friend&mdash;and it is
      as humanly simple as a barney between two old bush mates that threatens to
      end in a bloody fist-fight and separation for life, but chances to end in
      a beer. This quarrel threatened to end in the death of either Brutus or
      Cassius or a set-to between their two armies, just at the moment when they
      all should have been knit together against the forces of Mark Antony and
      Octavius Caesar; but it ended in a beer, or its equivalent, a bowl of
      wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in the quarrel, where Brutus asks why, after striking down the
      foremost man in all the world for supporting land agents and others,
      should they do the same thing and contaminate their fingers with base
      bribes?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             I&rsquo;d rather be a dog and bay the moon,
             Than such a Roman.
</pre>
    <p>
      Cassius says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Brutus, bait not me
             I&rsquo;ll not endure it: you forget yourself,
             To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
             Older in practice, abler than yourself
             To make conditions.

    Brutus:  Go to, you are not, Cassius.

    Cassius: I am.

    Brutus:  I say you are not.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so they get to it again until:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius: Is it come to this?

    Brutus:  You say you are a better soldier:
             Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
             And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
             I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

    Cassius: You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
             I said, an elder soldier, not a better.
             Did I say better?
</pre>
    <p>
      (What big boys they were&mdash;and what big boys we all are!)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Brutus:  If you did, I care not.

    Cassius: When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.

    Brutus:  Peace, peace! you durst not thus have tempted him.

    Cassius: I durst not!

    Brutus:  No.

    Cassius: What! Durst not tempt him!

    Brutus:  For your life you durst not.

    Cassius: Do not presume too much upon my love;
             I may do that I shall be sorry for.

    Brutus:  You have done that you should be sorry for.
</pre>
    <p>
      And so on till he gets to the matter of the refused quids, which is
      cleared up at the expense of the messenger.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius:  .... Brutus hath rived my heart
             A friend should bear his friend&rsquo;s infirmities,
             But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

    Brutus:  I do not, till you practise them on me.

    Cassius: You love me not.

    Brutus:  I do not like your faults.

    Cassius: A friendly eye could never see such faults.

    Brutus:  A flatterer&rsquo;s would not, though they do appear
             As huge as high Olympus.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then Cassius lets himself go. He calls on Antony and young Octavius and
      all the rest of &lsquo;em to come and be revenged on him alone, for he&rsquo;s tired
      of the world (&ldquo;Cassius is aweary of the world,&rdquo; he says). He&rsquo;s hated by
      one he loves (that&rsquo;s Brutus). He&rsquo;s braved by his &ldquo;brother&rdquo; (Brutus),
      checked like a bondman, and Brutus keeps an eye on all his faults and puts
      &lsquo;em down in a note-book, and learns &lsquo;em over and gets &lsquo;em off by memory to
      cast in his teeth. He offers Brutus his dagger and bare breast and wants
      Brutus to take out his heart, which, he says, is richer than all the quids&mdash;or
      rather gold&mdash;which Brutus said he wouldn&rsquo;t lend him. He wants Brutus
      to strike him as he did Caesar, for he reckons that when Brutus hated
      Caesar worst he loved him far better than ever he loved Cassius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember these men were Southerners, like ourselves, not cold-blooded
      Northerners&mdash;and, in spite of the seemingly effeminate Italian
      temperament, as brave as our men were at Elands River. The reason of
      Brutus&rsquo;s seeming coldness and hardness during the quarrel is set forth in
      a startling manner later on, as only the greatest poet in this world could
      do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutus tells him kindly to put up his pig-sticker (and button his shirt)
      and he could be just as mad or good-tempered as he liked, and do what he
      liked, Brutus wouldn&rsquo;t mind him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          .... Dishonour shall be humour.
             O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
             That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
             Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark
             And straight is cold again.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whereupon Cassius weeps because he thinks Brutus is laughing at him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Hath Cassius lived
             To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
             When grief and blood ill-temper&rsquo;d vexeth him.

    Brutus:  When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&rsquo;d too.

    Cassius: Do you confess so much?  Give me your hand.

    Brutus:  And my heart too.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then Cassius explains that he got his temper from his mother (as I did
      mine).
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius: O Brutus!

    Brutus:  What&rsquo;s the matter? [Shakespeare should have added `now.&lsquo;]

    Cassius: Have not you love enough to bear with me,
             When that rash humour which my mother gave me
             Makes me forgetful?

    Brutus:  Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
             When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
             He&rsquo;ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
</pre>
    <p>
      And all this on the brink of disaster and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here comes a rare touch, and we might as well quote it in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind you, I am following Shakespeare, and not history, which is mostly
      lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great poet&rsquo;s instinct might be nearer the truth; after all. Of course
      scholars know that Macbeth (or Macbethad) reigned for upwards of twenty
      years in Scotland a wise and a generous king&mdash;so much so that he was
      called &ldquo;Macbathad the Liberal,&rdquo; and it was Duncan who found his way to the
      throne by way of murder; but it didn&rsquo;t fit in with Shakespeare&rsquo;s plans,
      and&mdash;anyway that&rsquo;s only a little matter between the ghosts of Bill
      and Mac which was doubtless fixed up long ago. More likely they thought it
      such a one-millionth part of a trifle that they never dreamed of thinking
      of mentioning it.

    Brutus:  Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

    Cassius:  Bear with him, Brutus; &lsquo;tis his fashion.

</pre>
    <p>
      Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit a black eye (<i>Lawson</i>).
      Shakespeare was ever rough on poets&mdash;but stay! Consider that this
      great world of Rome and all the men and women in it were created by a
      &ldquo;jingling fool&rdquo; and a master of bad&mdash;not to say execrable&mdash;rhymes,
      and his name was William Shakespeare. You need to sit down and think
      awhile after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutus sends Lucilius and Titinius to bid the commanders lodge their
      companies for the night, and then all come to him. Then he gives Cassius a
      shock and strikes him to the heart for his share in the quarrel. It is
      almost directly after the row, when they have kicked out the &ldquo;jingling
      fool&rdquo; of a poet. Cassius does not know that Brutus has to-day received
      news of the death, in Rome, of his good and true wife Portia, who, during
      a fit of insanity, brought on by her grief and anxiety for Brutus, and in
      the absence of her attendant, has poisoned herself&mdash;or &ldquo;swallowed
      fire,&rdquo; as Shakespeare has it.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Brutus (to Lucius, his servant): Lucius, a bowl of wine!

    Brutus:  O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

             If you give place to accidental evils.

    Brutus:  No man bears sorrow better:&mdash;Portia is dead.

    Cassius: Ha! Portia!

    Brutus:  She is dead.

    Cassius: How &lsquo;scaped I killing when I cross&rsquo;d you so!

             Upon what sickness?

    Brutus:  Impatient of my absence,
             And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
             Have made themselves so strong: for with her death
             That tidings came; with this she fell distract,
             And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.

    Cassius: And died so?

    Brutus:  Even so.

    Cassius: O, ye immortal gods!

      You ought to read that scene carefully. It will do no one any harm. It did

      never know what&rsquo;s behind.

    <p>
      Titinius and Messala come in, and proceed to discuss the situation.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Brutus:  Come in, Titinius!!  Welcome, good Messala.
             Now sit we close about this taper here,
             And call in question our necessities.

    Cassius (on whom the wine seems to have taken some effect):
             Portia, art thou gone?

    Brutus:  No more, I pray you.
             Messala, I have here received letters,
             That young Octavius and Mark Antony
             Come down upon us with a mighty power,
             Bending their expedition towards Philippi.
</pre>
    <p>
      Messala has also letters to the same purpose, and they have likewise news
      of the murder, or execution, of upwards of a hundred senators in Rome.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius: Cicero one!
    Messala: Cicero is dead.
</pre>
    <p>
      Poor Brutus! His heart had cause to be sick of many griefs that day.
      Messala thinks he has news to break, and Brutus draws him out. How many
      and many a man and woman, with a lump in the throat, have broken sad and
      bad news since that day, and started out to do it in the same old gentle
      way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Messala: Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

    Brutus:  No, Messala.

    Messala: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

    Brutus:  Nothing, Messala.

    Messala: That, methinks, is strange.

    Brutus:  Why ask you?  Hear you aught of her in yours?
</pre>
    <p>
      Maybe it strikes Messala like a flash that Brutus is in no need of any
      more bad news just now, and it had better be postponed till after the
      battle:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Messala: No, my lord.

    Brutus:  Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

    Messala: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
             For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

    Brutus:  Why, farewell, Portia.  We must die, Messala:
             With meditating that she must die once
             I have the patience to endure it now.
</pre>
    <p>
      Poor Messala comes to the scratch again rather lamely with a little weak
      flattery: &ldquo;Even so great men great losses should endure;&rdquo; and Cassius
      says, rather mixedly&mdash;it might have been the wine&mdash;that he has
      as much strength in bearing trouble as Brutus has, and yet he couldn&rsquo;t
      bear it so.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             I have as much of this in art as you,
             But yet my nature could not bear it so.

    Brutus:  Well, to our work alive.  What do you think
             Of marching on Philippi presently?
</pre>
    <p>
      Brutus was a strong man. Portia&rsquo;s spirit must bide a while. They discuss a
      plan of campaign. Cassius is for waiting for the enemy to seek them and so
      get through his tucker and knock his men up, while they rest in a good
      position; but Brutus argues that the enemy will gather up the country
      people between Philippi and their camp and come on refreshed with added
      numbers and courage, and it would be better for them to meet him at
      Philippi with these people at their back. The politics or inclination of
      the said country people didn&rsquo;t matter in those days. &ldquo;There is a tide in
      the affairs of men&rdquo;&mdash;and so they decide to take it at the flood and
      float high on to the rocks at Philippi. Ah well, it led on to immortality,
      if it didn&rsquo;t to fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there&rsquo;s no more to say. Brutus thinks that the main thing now is a
      little rest&mdash;in which you&rsquo;ll agree with him; and he sends for his
      night-shirt.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Good night, Titinius:  noble, noble Cassius,
             Good night, and good repose!
</pre>
    <p>
      That old fool of a Cassius&mdash;remorseful old smooth-bore&mdash;is still
      a bit maudlin&mdash;maybe he had another swig at the wine when Shakespeare
      wasn&rsquo;t looking.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Cassius: O my dear brother!
             This was an ill beginning of the night
             Never come such division &lsquo;tween our souls!

    Brutus:  Everything is well.

    Cassius: Good night, my lord.

    Brutus:  Good sight, good brother.

      Titinius and Messala: Good night, Lord Brutus.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Brutus:  Farewell, every one.

    <p>
      And Cassius is the man whom Caesar denounced as having a lean and hungry
      look: &ldquo;Let me have men about me that are fat... such men are dangerous.&rdquo;
       (Mr Archibald held with that&mdash;and he had a lean, if not a hungry,
      look too.) When Antony put in a word for Cassius, Caesar said that he
      wished he was fatter anyhow. &ldquo;He thinks too much,&rdquo; Caesar said to Antony.
      He read a lot; he could look through men; he never went to the theatre,
      and heard no music; he never smiled except as if grinning sarcastically at
      himself for &ldquo;being moved to smile at anything.&rdquo; Caesar said that such men
      were never at heart&rsquo;s ease while they could see a bigger man than
      themselves, and therefore such men were dangerous. &ldquo;Come on my right hand,
      for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly what thou think&rsquo;st of him.&rdquo;
       (That&rsquo;s a touch, for deafness in people affected that way is usually
      greater in the left ear.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lucilius returned from taking a message from Brutus to Cassius <i>re</i>
      the loan of the fivers aforementioned and other matters&mdash;and before
      the arrival of Cassius with his horse and foot, and the quarrel&mdash;Brutus
      asked Lucilius what sort of a reception he had, and being told &ldquo;With
      courtesy and respect enough,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;Thou hast described a hot
      friend cooling,&rdquo; and so on. But Cassius will cool no more until death
      cools him to-morrow at Philippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rare gentleness of Brutus&rsquo;s character&mdash;and of the characters of
      thousands of other bosses in trouble&mdash;is splendidly, and ah! so
      softly, pictured in the tent with his servants after the departure of the
      others. It is a purely domestic scene without a hint of home, women, or
      children&mdash;save that they themselves are big children. The scene now
      has the atmosphere of a soft, sad nightfall, after a long, long, hot and
      weary day full of toil and struggle and trouble&mdash;though it is really
      well on towards morning.
    </p>

      Lucius comes in with the gown. Brutus says, &ldquo;Give me the gown,&rdquo; and asks
      where his (Lucius&rsquo;s) musical instrument is, and Lucius replies that it&rsquo;s
      here in the tent. Brutus notices that he speaks drowsily. &ldquo;Poor knave, I
      blame thee not, thou are o&rsquo;er-watched.&rdquo; He tells him to call Claudius and
      some other of his men: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have them sleep on cushions in my tent.&rdquo; They
      come. He tells them he might have to send them on business by and by to
      his &ldquo;brother&rdquo; Cassius, and bids them lie down and sleep, calling them
      sirs. They say they&rsquo;ll stand and watch his pleasure. &ldquo;I will not have it
      so; lie down, good sirs.&rdquo; He finds, in the pocket of his gown, a book he&rsquo;d
      been hunting high and low for&mdash;and had evidently given Lucius a warm
      time about&mdash;and he draws Lucius&rsquo;s attention to the fact:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             Look, Lucius, here&rsquo;s the book I sought for so:
             I put it in the pocket of my gown.

     Lucius: I was sure your lordship did not give it to me.

     Brutus: Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful, etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      He asks Lucius if he can hold up his heavy eyes and touch his instrument a
      strain or two. But better give it all&mdash;it&rsquo;s not long:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Lucius: Ay, my lord, an&rsquo;t please you.

     Brutus: It does, my boy:
             I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

     Lucius: It is my duty, sir.

     Brutus: I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
             I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

     Lucius: I have slept, my lord, already.

     Brutus: It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
             I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
             I will be good to thee.  (Music, and a song.)
             This is a sleepy tune.  O murderous slumber,
             Lay&rsquo;st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
             That plays thee music?  Gentle knave, good-night;
             I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
             If thou dost nod, thou break&rsquo;st thy instrument;
             I&rsquo;ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good-night.
             Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn&rsquo;d down
             Where I left reading?  Here it is, I think.
                                                 (He sits down.)
</pre>
    <p>
      A man for all time! How natural it all reads! You must remember that he is
      a tired man after a long, strenuous day such as none of us ever know. The
      fate of Rome and his&mdash;a much smaller matter&mdash;are hanging on the
      balance, and tomorrow will decide; but he is so mind-dulled and
      shoulder-weary under the tremendous burden of great things and of many
      griefs that he is almost apathetic; and over all is the cloud of a loss
      that he has not yet had time to realize. He is self-hypnotized, so to
      speak, and his mind mercifully dulled for the moment on the Sea of
      Fatalism.

                                         Enter GHOST of CAESAR

     Brutus: How ill this taper burns!  Ha! who comes here?
             I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
             That shapes this monstrous apparition.
             It comes upon me.  Art thou any thing?
             Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil
             That makest my blood cold, and my hair to stare?
             Speak to me what thou art!
</pre>
    <p>
      His very &ldquo;scare,&rdquo; or rather his cold blood and staring hair are as things
      apart, to be analysed and explained quickly and put aside.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ghost:  Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
</pre>
    <p>
      That was frank enough, anyway.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus: Why comest thou?

     Ghost:  To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

     Brutus: Well; then I shall see thee again?

     Ghost:  Ay, at Philippi.
                                    (Vanishes.)
</pre>
    <p>
      That was very satisfactory, so far. But Brutus, having taken heart, as he
      says, would hold more talk with the &ldquo;ill spirit.&rdquo; A ghost always needs to
      be taken quietly&mdash;it&rsquo;s no use getting excited and threshing round.
      But Caesar&rsquo;s, being a new-chum ghost and bashful, was doubtless
      embarrassed by his cool, matter-of-fact reception, and left. It didn&rsquo;t
      matter much. They were to meet soon, above Philippi, on more level terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot get away from the idea that Caesar&rsquo;s ghost&rsquo;s visit was made
      in a friendly spirit. Who knows? Perhaps Portia&rsquo;s spirit had sent it to
      comfort Brutus: her own being prevented from going for some reason only
      known to the immortal gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Brutus wakes them all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Lucius: The strings, my lord, are false.

     Brutus: He thinks he is still at his instrument.
             Lucius, awake!
</pre>
    <p>
      And after questioning them as to whether they cried out in their sleep, or
      saw anything, he bids the boy sleep again (it is easy for tired boys to
      sleep at will in camp) and sends two of the others to Cassius to bid him
      get his forces on the way early and he would follow.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus: Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
             Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
             And we will follow.

     Varro and Claudius: It shall be done, my lord.
</pre>
    <p>
      For, being a wise soldier, as well as a brave and gentle one, he reckoned,
      no doubt, that it would be best to have a strong man in the rear until the
      field was actually reached, for the benefit of would-be deserters, and
      unconsidered trifles of country people-and maybe for another reason not
      totally disconnected with his erratic friend Cassius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just one more scene, and a very different one, before we hurry on to the
      end, as they have done to Philippi. It&rsquo;s the only scene in which those two
      unlucky Romans, Cassius and Brutus, seem to score.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is during the barney, or as Shakespeare calls it, the &ldquo;parley&rdquo; before
      the battle. Those parleys never seemed to do any good&mdash;except to make
      matters worse, if I might put it like that: it&rsquo;s the same, under similar
      circumstances, right up to to-day. Enter on one side Octavius Caesar, Mark
      Antony, and their pals and army; and, on the other, Brutus and Cassius and
      the friends and followers of their falling fortunes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus: Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?

     Octavius: Not that we love words better, as you do.
</pre>
    <p>
      You see, Octavius starts it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutus lays himself open:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus: Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
     Antony: In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
             Witness the hole you made in Caesar&rsquo;s heart,
             Crying, &ldquo;Long live! hail, Caesar!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is one for Brutus, though it contains a lie. But Cassius comes to the
      rescue:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Cassius: Antony,
              The posture of your blows are yet unknown,
              But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees
              And leave them honeyless.

     Antony:  Not stingless too.

     Brutus:  O, yes, and soundless too;
              For you have stol&rsquo;n their buzzing, Antony,
              And very wisely threat before you sting.
</pre>
    <p>
      That was one for Antony, and he gets mad. &ldquo;Villains!&rdquo; he yells, and he
      abuses them about their vile daggers hacking one another in the sides of
      Caesar (a little matter that ought to be worn threadbare by now), and
      calls them apes and hounds and bondmen and curs, and O, flatterers (which
      seems to be worst of all in his opinion&mdash;for he isn&rsquo;t one, you know),
      and damns &lsquo;em generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Cassius remarks, &ldquo;Flatterers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Octavius breaks loose, and draws his Roman chopper and waves it
      round, and spreads himself out over Caesar&rsquo;s three-and-thirty wounds&mdash;which
      ought to be given a rest by this time, but only seem to be growing in
      number&mdash;and swears that he won&rsquo;t put up said chopper till said wounds
      are avenged,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              Or till another Caesar
              Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
</pre>
    <p>
      Brutus says quietly that he cannot die by traitors unless he brings &lsquo;em
      with him. (He sent one to Egypt later on.) Octavius says he hopes he
      wasn&rsquo;t born to die on Brutus&rsquo;s sword; and Brutus says, in effect, that
      even if he was any good he couldn&rsquo;t die more honourably.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
              Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.

     Cassius: A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
              Join&rsquo;d with a masker and a reveller!
</pre>
    <p>
      Octavius calls off his dogs, and tells them to come on to-day if they
      dare, or if not, when they have stomachs.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Cassius: Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
              The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, I reckon old Cassius (&ldquo;old&rdquo; in an affectionate sense) and Brutus came
      out top dogs from that scrap anyway. And, yes, Antony <i>was</i> good at
      orating. He was great at orating over dead men&mdash;especially dead
      &ldquo;friends&rdquo; (as he called his rivals) and dead enemies. Brutus was &ldquo;the
      noblest Roman of them all&rdquo; when Antony came across him stiff later on. Now
      when I die&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Octavius, by the way, orated over Antony and his dusky hussy later on in
      Egypt, and they were the most &ldquo;famous pair&rdquo; in the world. I wonder whether
      the grim humour of it struck Octavius <i>then</i>: but then that young man
      seemed to have but little brains and less humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now they go to see about settling the matter with ironmongery. You can
      imagine the fight; the heat and the dust, for it was spring in a climate
      like ours. The bullocking, sweating, grunting, slaughter, the crack and
      clash and rattle as of fire-irons in a fender. The bad Latin language; the
      running away and chasing <i>en masse</i> and by individuals. The mutual
      pauses, the truces or spells&mdash;&ldquo;smoke-ho&rsquo;s&rdquo; we&rsquo;d call &lsquo;em&mdash;between
      masses and individuals. The battered-in, lost, discarded or stolen
      helmets; the blood-stained, dinted, and loosened armour with bits missing,
      and the bloody and grotesque bandages. The confusion amongst the soldiers,
      as it is to-day&mdash;the ignorance of one wing as to the fate of the
      other, of one party as to the fate of the other, of one individual as to
      the fate of another:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills [directions
                 to officers]
              Unto the legions on the other side:
</pre>
    <p>
      Poor Cassius, routed and in danger of being surrounded, and thinking
      Brutus is in the same plight, or a prisoner or dead&mdash;and that
      Titinius is taken or killed&mdash;gets his bondman, whose life he once
      saved, to kill him in return for his freedom.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
              And when my face is cover &lsquo;d, as &lsquo;tis now,
              Guide thou the sword.
                       Caesar, thou art revenged,
              Even with the sword that kill&rsquo;d thee.
</pre>
    <p>
      Good-bye, Cassius, old chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      Titinius and Messala, coming too late, find Cassius dead; and Titinius,
      being left alone while Messala takes the news to Brutus, kills himself
      with Cassius&rsquo;s sword. Titinius, farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      Come Brutus and those that are left.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

     Messala: Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

     Brutus:  Titinius&rsquo; face is upward.

     Cato:    He is slain.
</pre>
    <p>
      Grim mates in a grim day in a grim hour. Then the cry of Brutus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
</pre>
    <p>
      But if he were, perhaps he only gathered old Cassius and Titinius to be
      sure of their company with him and Brutus amongst the gods a little later.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  Friends, I owe more tears
              To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
              I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
</pre>
    <p>
      And, after making arrangements for the removal of Cassius&rsquo;s body, they go
      to try their fortunes in a second fight. Young Cato is killed and good
      Lucilius taken. Comes Brutus beaten, with Dardanius his last friend, and
      his three servants, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
</pre>
    <p>
      Strato, exhausted, goes to sleep, as man can sleep during a battle; and
      Brutus whispers the others, one after another, to kill him; but they are
      shocked and refuse: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rather kill myself,&rdquo; &ldquo;I do such a deed?&rdquo; etc. He
      begs Volumnius, his old schoolmate, to hold his sword-hilt while he runs
      on it, for their love of old.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Volumnius: That&rsquo;s not the office for a friend, my lord.
</pre>
    <p>
      There are alarums, and they urge him to fly, for it&rsquo;s no use stopping
      there.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
              Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
              Farewell to thee too, Strato! Countrymen,
              My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
              I found so man but he was true to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ye gods! but it&rsquo;s grand. I wish to our God that I could say as much&mdash;or
      that man or woman [n]ever found me untrue. Could Antony say as much,
      afterwards, in Egypt&mdash;or Octavius! with Antony then on his mind? Even
      Antony&rsquo;s last man and servant failed him in the end, killing himself
      rather than kill his master. But Strato&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more alarums and voices calling to them to run. They urge Brutus
      again, and he tells them to go and he&rsquo;ll follow. They all run except
      Strato, who hesitates.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Brutus:  I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
              Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
              Thy life hath had some snatch of honour in it
              Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
              While I do run upon it.  Wilt thou, Strato?

     Strato:  Give me your hand first: fare you well, my lord.

     Brutus:  Farewell, good Strato.  Caesar, now be still:
              I kill&rsquo;d not thee with half so good a will.
</pre>
    <p>
      Brutus, good night!
    </p>
    <p>
      I like Shakespeare&rsquo;s servants. They seem to show that he sprang from
      servants or common people rather than from lords and masters, for he deals
      with them very gently. It must be understood that servants, bond and free,
      were born unto the same house and served it for generations; and so down
      to modern England, where the old nurse and the tottering old gardener
      often nursed and played with &ldquo;Master Will,&rdquo; when his father, the dead and
      gone old squire, was a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      See where Timon&rsquo;s servants stand in the only patch of sunlight in that
      black and bitter story:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    Enter Flavius, with two or three SERVANTS.

     1 Serv.: Hear you, master steward, where&rsquo;s our master?
              Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?

     Flav.:   Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
              Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
              I am as poor as you.

     1 Serv.: Such a house broke!
              So noble a master fall&rsquo;n!  All gone! and not
              One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
              And go along with him!

     2 Serv.: As we do turn our backs
              From our companion thrown into his grave,
              So his familiars to his buried fortunes
              Slink all away; leave their false vows with him,
              Like empty purses pick&rsquo;d; and his poor self,
              A dedicated beggar to the air,
              With his disease of all-shunn&rsquo;d poverty,
              Walks, like contempt, alone.  More of our fellows.

                                      Enter other Servants

     Flav.:   All broken implements of a ruin&rsquo;d house.

     3 Serv.: Yet do our hearts wear Timon&rsquo;s livery;
              That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
              Serving alike in sorrow: leak&rsquo;d is our bark,
              And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
              Hearing the surges threat; we must all part
              Into this sea of air.

     Flav.:   Good fellows all,
              The latest of my wealth I&rsquo;ll share amongst you.
              Wherever we shall meet, for Timon&rsquo;s sake
              Let&rsquo;s yet be fellows; let&rsquo;s shake our heads, and say,
              As &lsquo;twere a knell unto our master&rsquo;s fortunes,
              &ldquo;We have seen better days.&rdquo;  Let each take some.
                                             (Giving them money.)
              Nay, put out all your hands.  Not one word more:
              Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
